1.  [!!!USE THE "DOCUMENT MAP" VIEW FUNCTION!!!]{.underline}

2.  !!!MINIMIZE EVERYTHING IN THE DOCUMENT MAP FIRST!!!

3.  This file has internal link, impact, and framework cards applicable
    to nearly all possible LD resolutions.

4.  I suggest reading and cutting articles specific to the topic for
    links and uniqueness.

5.  A LOT of the cards overlap and can be reasonably placed in different
    categories. However, there are very few duplicate cards (cards that
    could be in multiple categories only appear once in the file). Thus,
    if you\'re looking for a particular card in what seems like its most
    likely categorization, you may not find it there and will have to
    search elsewhere in the file. I guarantee that you'll find what
    you're looking for if you search hard enough. (Some defense cards
    might be in the offensive sections etc.).

6.  As such, I would advise against using this file in-round since the
    cards aren't partitioned enough and many different cards are lumped
    together under a very broad heading. I would recommend writing
    blocks pre-round with this file. However, if you need carded answers
    to arguments you haven't heard before or if you know the file
    extremely well, then go for it.

7.  And given how LD works, you'll probably be successful just by
    reading the taglines of these cards and then making short
    extrapolations and analytics on the fly...

8.  Have fun!

## Human dignity is the highest standard

George Kateb, Professor of Politics, Princeton, THE INNER OCEAN, 1992,
p. 9

In sum, [there seems to be no generally credible foundation for a
critique of rights]{.underline}. [Rights emerge as the only or best way
of protecting human dignity, and human dignity remains the highest
standard.]{.underline} This is not to deny that there will be strenuous
differences of interpretation of various rights and quarrels over the
comparative importance of various rights. But by now [even]{.underline}
some [anti-individualists]{.underline}, whether secular or religious,
[accept the idea of rights as useful or even as an indispensable
ingredient in their own thinking about politics and
society.]{.underline}

##  Moral obligation to protect liberty

Edward **Crane**, President of the Cato Institute, VITAL SPEECHES OF THE
DAY, September 15-17, 19**96**, p. 597

Those are words that we need to hear more of. It\'s true, [freedom and
morality do, ultimately, depend on each other for their
existence.]{.underline} But as government grows year in and year out,
under Democratic and Republican administrations, as regulations
multiply, politically correct public education expands, and our tax
burden gets ever greater, [I can\'t help but think the reservoir of
morality in America is much deeper than our reservoir of political
liberty. The crisis we confront is a political crisis - one that merits
our immediate attention. We have,]{.underline} it seems to me, [a moral
imperative to challenge the political status quo and to roll back the
20th century\'s legacy of statism.]{.underline} It is our heritage as
Americans to live in a civil society - not a society that is
increasingly politicized. [If we want a more moral society,]{.underline}
then, as Barry Goldwater said, [liberty must be our main
interest.]{.underline} Thank you.

However, one may still insist on echoing Ernest Hemingway -- "[I believe
in only one thing: liberty]{.underline}." And it is always well to bear
in mind David Hume's observation: "[It is seldom that liberty of any
kind is lost all at once." Thus, it is unacceptable to say that the
invasion of one aspect of freedom is of no import because there have
been invasions of so many other aspects. That road leads to chaos,
tyranny, despotism, and the end of all human aspiration]{.underline}.
Ask Solzhenstyn, Ask Milovan Djilas. In sum, [if one believes in freedom
as a supreme value and proper ordering principle for any society aiming
to maximize spiritual and material welfare, then every invasion of
freedom must be emphatically identified and resisted with undying
spirit]{.underline}.

## Coercion outweighs, conditions like poverty are inevitable, it's futile to try to solve. {#coercion-outweighs-conditions-like-poverty-are-inevitable-its-futile-to-try-to-solve. .Tags}

**Kelley**, founder and senior fellow of the Atlas Society, **98**

(David Kelley, founder and senior fellow of the Atlas Society, 1998, "A
life of one\'s own," p68-69)

To be sure, there is not always a hard and fast distinction between the
number of alternatives one has and the degree of one's freedom to choose
among them. Theoretically, any obstacle, restraint, or limitation may be
looked at in either of two ways: we may view it (1) as something that
eliminates one or more alternatives a person would otherwise have
available or (2) something that prevents the person from choosing one or
more alternatives. The difference lies in whether we consider the
limitation as affecting the range of alternatives he has or the process
of choosing among them. Advocates of positive freedom have exploited
this fact, insisting that lack of a certain opportunity because of
poverty, illness, or disability deprives a person of the freedom to
choose that opportunity. Conversely, we could in principle view overt
coercion, physical force, or violence, not as something that prevents a
person from choosing an alternative but as something that removes
alternatives he would otherwise have. There are real differences between
(1) and (2). One difference is whether the obstacle or limitation is
imposed by reality or by other people. When some fact of reality affects
the range of alternatives we face, it is wishful thinking to regard it
as an obstacle to what we would otherwise be free to do. Facts are
facts. The world operates a certain way, according to causal laws, and
the constraints imposed by nature are the foundation for human choice,
not a barrier to it. A farmer plants a field and tends it over the
growing season, but a hailstorm destroys the crop before he can harvest
it. It would be bizarre to say that the hailstorm abridged his freedom
to reap what he has sown. As a natural event, the hailstorm is a
misfortune that eliminates the possibility of a harvest. By contrast, if
a government price-support regulation forbids the farmer to harvest the
crop, the restraint arises from human action and does abridge his
freedom to what he otherwise could.

A single question added to each of the above eight clauses would make
the issue clear: At whose expense? Jobs, food, clothing, recreation (I),
homes, medical care, education, etc., do not grow in nature. These are
man-made values---goods and services produced by men. Who is to provide
them? If some men are entitled by right to the products of the work of
others, it means that those others are deprived of rights and condemned
to slave labor. Any alleged \"right\" of one man, which necessitates the
violation of the rights of another, is not and cannot be a right. No man
can have a right to impose an unchosen obligation, an unrewarded duty or
an involuntary servitude on another man. There can be no such thing as
\"the right to enslave." A right does not include the material
implementation of that right by other men; it includes only the freedom
to earn that implementation by one\'s own effort. Observe, in this
context, the intellectual precision of the Founding Fathers: they spoke
of the right to the Pursuit of happiness---not of the right to
happiness. It means that a man has the right to take the actions he
deems necessary to achieve his happiness; it does not mean that others
must make him happy.

## Coercion is immoral -- denies individuals the capacity develop as moral agents. {#coercion-is-immoral-denies-individuals-the-capacity-develop-as-moral-agents. .Tags}

Edward **Feser,** philosophy professor, Loyola, ON NOZICK, 20**04**, p.
37-8

More hopeful is the strategy, pursued by a large number of libertarian
philosophers, of appealing to a broadly

Aristotelian account of morality (Mack 1981; Machan 1989; Rasmussen and
Den Uyl 1991; Smith 1995).

On Aristotle's view, the fundamental moral question is not "What is the
right thing to do?" but rather "What traits of character should I
develop?" Only when one has determined what traits these are \-- that
is, what habitual patterns of action count as virtues can one go on to
answer the subordinate question of how one ought to act in a particular
case (the answer being that one should act the way someone possessing
the virtue relevant to that situation would act). What count as the
virtues, in turn, are just those qualities most conducive to enabling
human beings to fulfill the potentials which distinguish them as the
unique sorts of beings they are --- those qualities, that is, which best
allow human beings to flourish given their distinctive human nature.
Given that human beings are by nature rational animals, we can flourish
only if we practice those virtues governing practical and theoretical
reason. It follows that we have reason to acquire intellectual virtues
like truthfulness and practical virtues such as temperance and courage,
and to avoid such corresponding vices as licentiousness and cowardice.
Given that human beings are also by nature social animals, we can only
flourish if we practice also those virtues governing interaction with
other human beings, so that we have reason to acquire such social
virtues as honesty and loyalty. Though the moral life will involve
decision-making about what to do in a particular concrete situation,
then, it involves more basically the gradual development of a good
character by the taking on of the virtues and the weeding out of vices
--- it essentially involves, that is, a process of self-perfection. Only
a person who voluntarily decides to do so can carry out this process,
however virtue must be freely chosen if it is truly to count as virtue.
Moreover, the specific requirements of virtuous behavior depend to a
considerable extent on the unique circumstances of the situation and the
individual person involved, circumstances knowable only to that person
himself in the concrete contexts of moral decision- making. The moral
life, then, is only fully possible under conditions wherein the
individual is capable of self-direction (in Rasmussen and Den Uyl's
terms), the absence of coercion and interference from outside forces.
Allowing others such self-direction is necessary too if the individual
is to allow those others also to develop the virtues; and in general,
respecting others' autonomy is essential if one is successfully to
cooperate with them as fellow citizens, and thus fulfill one's own
nature as a social being. Given the centrality of self-direction to
self- perfection, then, respect for the rights of self-ownership turns
out to be required for the successful pursuit of the moral life.

## ***[Evaluate freedom first -- it is critical to both prosperity and fairness]{.underline}***  {#evaluate-freedom-first-it-is-critical-to-both-prosperity-and-fairness .Tags}

**[Richard L]{.underline}***.* **Stroup** (professor of economics at
Montana State University) **1987:** REFLECTIONS ON FREEDOM, FAIRNESS,
AND THE CONSTITUTION

[Freedom]{.underline} (with accountability) [is the key to both
prosperity and to any reasonable and realistic conception of
fairness]{.underline}. [Only with entrepreneurial freedom will the
innovation required to increase prosperity occur. And only through
freedom and prosperity can fairness--- in the sense of benefits accruing
to those with low incomes, as well as fair treatment under the law---be
maintained]{.underline}. Both [freedom and prosperity are incompatible
with extensive regulatory or tax/transfer powers in the hands of
government]{.underline}. This paper argues that [freedom, fairness, and
prosperity are unalterably linked and require strong constitutional
constraints on government]{.underline}. A powerful case can be made for
small, secure, but constrained and competing governments ofthe sort a
federal system suggests. As James Buchanan's work indicates, in today's
world Hobbesian anarchy is not likely to yield freedom, economic growth
and prosperity, or fairness. In this world, I believe we do need
government. Restraints on government, however, are the key to freedom
and fairness. [Few would dispute the need for restraints to maintain
freedom, but the restraints on government are necessary for fairness as
well.]{.underline} Why? [Individuals are not equally endowed with
effectiveness in market earnings, nor in the market for political
influence. There will be elites in any system, and those *who* are not
members of the elite are far better offwhen the influence of elites is
diffused, as in a free society with constrained
government]{.underline}---[with freedom of entry and exit, operating
under the rule ofwilling consent. Thus a government with the power to
prevent arbitrary abuse of some people by others, but with sharply
limited power to coerce others directly and in detail, is likely to
provide maximum freedom,and hence maximum prosperity and fairness as
well.]{.underline}

Ludwig von **Mises** (Austrian Economist and Philosopher) **1960**: The
Economic Foundations of Freedom. http://mises.org/efandi/ch1.asp

[Animals are driven by instinctive urges. They yield to the impulse
which prevails at the moment and peremptorily asks for satisfaction.
They are the puppets of their appetites]{.underline}. [Man\'s eminence
is to be seen in the fact that he chooses between
alternatives]{.underline}. He regulates his behavior deliberatively. He
can master his impulses and desires; he has the power to suppress wishes
the satisfaction of which would force him to renounce the attainment of
more important goals. In short: [man acts; he purposively aims at ends
chosen. This is what we have in mind in stating that man is a moral
person, responsible for his conduct.]{.underline} **Freedom as a
Postulate of Morality**

[All the teachings and precepts of ethics]{.underline}, whether based
upon a religious creed or whether based upon a secular doctrine like
that of the Stoic philosophers, [presuppose this moral autonomy of the
individual and therefore appeal to the individual\'s conscience. They
presuppose that the individual is free to choose among various modes of
conduct and require him to behave in compliance with definite rules, the
rules of morality.]{.underline} Do the right things, shun the bad
things. It is obvious that [the exhortations and admonishments of
morality make sense only when addressing individuals who are free
agents. They are vain when directed to slaves. It is useless to tell a
bondsman what is morally good and what is morally bad. He is not free to
determine his comportment; he is forced to obey the orders of his
master]{.underline}. It is difficult to blame him if he prefers yielding
to the commands of his master to the most cruel punishment threatening
not only him but also the members of his family. [This is why freedom is
not only a political postulate, but no less a postulate of every
religious or secular morality]{.underline}. **The Struggle for Freedom**
Yet for thousands of years a considerable part of mankind was either
entirely or at least in many regards deprived of the faculty to choose
between what is right and what is wrong. In the status society of days
gone by the freedom to act according to their own choice was, for the
lower strata of society, the great majority of the population, seriously
restricted by a rigid system of controls. An outspoken formulation of
this principle was the statute of the Holy Roman Empire that conferred
upon the princes and counts of the Reich (Empire) the power and the
right to determine the religious allegiance of their subjects. The
Orientals meekly acquiesced in this state of affairs. But the Christian
peoples of Europe and their scions that settled in overseas territories
never tired in their struggle for liberty. Step by step they abolished
all status and caste privileges and disabilities until they finally
succeeded in establishing the system that the harbingers of
totalitarianism try to smear by calling it the bourgeois system. **The
Supremacy of the Consumers** The economic foundation of this bourgeois
system is the market economy in which the consumer is sovereign. The
consumer, i.e., everybody, determines by his buying or abstention from
buying what should be produced, in what quantity and of what quality.
The businessmen are forced by the instrumentality of profit and loss to
obey the orders of the consumers, Only those enterprises can flourish
that supply in the best possible and cheapest way those commodities and
services which the buyers are most anxious to acquire. Those who fail to
satisfy the public suffer losses and are finally forced to go out of
business. In the precapitalistic ages the rich were the owners of large
landed estates. They or their ancestors had acquired their property as
gifts?feuds or fiefs?from the sovereign who?with their aid?had conquered
the country and subjugated its inhabitants. These aristocratic
landowners were real lords as they did not depend on the patronage of
buyers. But the rich of a capitalistic industrial society are subject to
the supremacy of the market. They acquire their wealth by serving the
consumers better than other people do and they forfeit their wealth when
other people satisfy the wishes of the consumers better or cheaper than
they do. In the free market economy the owners of capital are forced to
invest it in those lines in which it best serves the public. Thus
ownership of capital goods is continually shifted into the hands of
those who have best succeeded in serving the consumers. In the market
economy private property is in this sense a public service imposing upon
the owners the responsibility of employing it in the best interests of
the sovereign consumers. This is what economists mean when they call the
market economy a democracy in which every penny gives a right to vote.
**The Political Aspects of Freedom** Representative government is the
political corollary of the market economy. The same spiritual movement
that created modern capitalism substituted elected officeholders for the
authoritarian rule of absolute kings and hereditary aristocracies. It
was this much-decried bourgeois liberalism that brought freedom of
conscience, of thought, of speech, and of the press and put an end to
the intolerant persecution of dissenters. [A free country is one in
which every citizen is free to fashion his life according to his own
plans. He is free to compete on the market for the most desirable jobs
and on the political scene for the highest offices. He does not depend
more on other people\'s favor than these others depend on his favor. If
he wants to succeed on the market, he has to satisfy the consumers; if
he wants to succeed in public affairs he has to satisfy the
voters.]{.underline} This system has brought to the capitalistic
countries of Western Europe, America, and Australia an unprecedented
increase in population figures and the highest standard of living ever
known in history. The much talked-about common man has at his disposal
amenities of which the richest men in precapitalistic ages did not even
dream. He is in a position to enjoy the spiritual and intellectual
achievements of science, poetry, and art that in earlier days were
accessible only to a small elite of well-to-do people. And he is free to
worship as his conscience tells him.

## Coercion restricts rights and destroys individual agency. {#coercion-restricts-rights-and-destroys-individual-agency. .Tags}

**Blake**, Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of
Washington, **01**

(Michael Blake, Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of
Washington, Summer 2001, Distributive Justice, State Coercion, and
Autonomy, Philosophy and Public Affairs, Vol. 30, No. 3 (Summer, 2001),
pp. 257-296, JSTOR)

There is much more to be said in the above context, but I want now to
turn to the issue of coercion. People can be denied their autonomy by
being starved, deeply impoverished, or subjected to oppressive and
marginalizing norms, but they can also face a denial of autonomy that
results from outright coercion. I will refrain from offering a complete
theory of coercion in the present context;\'4 I will only note that, as
I have insisted upon throughout this exercise, whether an individual
faces a denial of autonomy resulting from coercion cannot be read off
simply from the number of options open to her. Coercion is not simply a
matter of what options are available; it has to do with the reasons the
set of options is as constrained as it is. Coercion is an intentional
action, designed to replace the chosen option with the choice of
another. Coercion, we might therefore say, expresses a relationship of
domination, violating the autonomy of the individual by replacing that
indi- vidual\'s chosen plans and pursuits with those of another. Let us
say, therefore, that coercive proposals violate the autonomy of those
against whom they are employed; they act so as to replace our own agency
with the agency of another.

Each increase in coercion is easier to justify. If it's right to force
banks to report your finances to the government, then it's right to
force you to justify the cash in your pocket at the airport. If it's
right to take property from the rich and give it to the poor, then it's
right to take your property for the salt marsh harvest mouse. As each
government program fails, it becomes "necessary" to move another step
closer to complete control over our lives. As one thing leads to another
-- as coercion leads to more coercion -- what can we look forward to? --
Will it become necessary to force you to justify everything you do to
any government agent who thinks you might be a threat to society? --
Will it become necessary to force your children to report your personal
habits to their teachers or the police? -- Will it become necessary to
force your neighbors to monitor your activities? -- Will it become
necessary to force you to attend a reeducation program to learn how to
be more sensitive, or how not to discriminate, or how to avoid being
lured into taking drugs, or how to recognize suspicious behavior? --
Will it become necessary to prohibit some of your favorite foods and ban
other pleasures, so you don't fall ill or have an accident -- putting a
burden on America's health-care system? Some of these things -- such as
getting children to snitch on their parents or ordering people into
reeducation programs -- are already happening in America. The others
have been proposed and are being considered seriously. History has shown
that each was an important step in the evolution of the world's worst
tyrannies. We move step by step further along the road to oppression
because each step seems like such a small one. And because we're told
that each step will give us something alluring in return -- less crime,
cheaper health care, safety from terrorists, an end to discrimination --
even if none of the previous steps delivered on its promise. And because
the people who promote these steps are well-meaning reformers who would
use force only to build a better world.

(F.A. Hayek, Nobel Prize winner for Economics, 1960, The Constitution of
Liberty, p.20)

By "coercion" we mean such control of the environment or circumstances
of a person by another that, in order to avoid greater evil, he is
forced to act not according to a coherent plan of his own but to serve
the ends of another. Except in the sense of choosing the lesser evil in
a situation forced on him by another, he is unable either to use his own
intelligence or knowledge or to follow his own aims and beliefs.
Coercion is evil precisely because it thus eliminates an individual as a
thinking and valuing person and makes him a bare tool in the achievement
of the ends of another. Free action, in which a person pursues his own
aims by the means indicated by his own knowledge, must be based on data
which cannot be shaped at will by another. It presupposes the existence
of a known sphere in which the circumstances cannot be so shaped by
another person as to leave one only that choice prescribed by the other.

## Utilitarianism doesn't trump the impact of coercion---individuals can't be reduced to units of value. {#utilitarianism-doesnt-trump-the-impact-of-coercionindividuals-cant-be-reduced-to-units-of-value. .Tags}

Machan, 95 Professor of philosophy, Auburn University, 1995 (Tibor,
PRIVATE RIGHTS AND PUBLIC ILLUSIONS, 1995, p. 129)

The essential point to note at this juncture is how the idea of the
worth and rights of the individual simply cannot find a place in the
standard utilitarian cost-benefit analysis favored by many economists.
Benefits, according to this approach, are to be measured by what people
prefer (or would prefer, if properly informed), while costs are
reducible to what people would prefer to do without or avoid if they
were properly informed. The kind of value (or worth) individuals have,
however, is not just one benefit competing among other
benefits\...Consider the case where some people are injured or harmed by
others. \"Since the costs of injury are borne by its victims,\" Kelman
contends, \"while its benefits are escaped by its perpetrators, simple
cost-benefit calculations may be less important than more abstract
conceptions of justice, fairness, and human dignity. Developing this
theme more fully, Kelman writes as follows: We would not condone a rape
even if it could be demonstrated that the rapist derived enormous
pleasure from his actions, while the victim suffered in only small ways.
Behind the conception of \"rights\" is the notion that some concept of
justice, fairness or human dignity demands that individuals ought to be
able to perform certain acts, despite the harm of others, and ought to
be protected against certain acts, despite the loss this causes to the
would-be perpetrator. Thus we undertake no cost-benefit analysis of the
effects of freedom of speech or trial by jury before allowing them to
continue.

director of public policy at American Liberty Foundation, editor of
Liberty Magazine, financial advisor and economist, 19**95**, Why
Government Doesn't Work)

The reformers of the Cambodian revolution claimed to be building a
better world. They forced people into reeducation programs to make them
better citizens. Then they used force to regulate every aspect of
commercial life. Then they forced office workers and intellectuals to
give up their jobs and harvest rice, to round out their education. When
people resisted having their lives turned upside down, the reformers had
to use more and more force.

By the time they were done, they had killed a third of the country's
population, destroyed the lives of almost everyone still alive, and
devastated a nation. **It all began with using force for the best of
intentions** --- **to create a better world**.

The Soviet leaders used coercion to provide economic security and to
build a "New Man" --- a human being who would put his fellow man ahead
of himself. At least 10 million people died to help build the New Man
and the Workers' Paradise.37 But human nature never changed --- and the
workers' lives were always Hell, not Paradise.

In the 1930s many Germans gladly traded civil liberties for the economic
revival and national pride Adolf Hitler promised them. But like every
other grand dream to improve society by force, it ended in a nightmare
of devastation and death.

Professor R. J. Rummel has calculated that 119 million people have been
killed *by their own governments* in this century.38 Were these people
criminals? No, they were people who simply didn't fit into the New Order
--- people who

preferred their own dreams to those of the reformers. **Every time you
allow government to use force to make society better, you move another
step closer to the nightmares of Cambodia, the Soviet Union, and Nazi
Germany**.

We've already moved so far that our own government can perform with
impunity the outrages described in the preceding chapters. These
examples aren't cases of government gone wrong; they are examples of
government --- period. They are what governments do --- just as chasing
cats is what dogs do. They are the natural consequence of letting
government use force to bring about a drug-free nation, to tax someone
else to better your life, to guarantee your economic security, to assure
that no one can mistreat you or hurt your feelings, and to cover up the
damage of all the failed government programs that came before.

## Government coercion is immoral because it kills freedom and virtue by eroding the basis of free market capitalism {#government-coercion-is-immoral-because-it-kills-freedom-and-virtue-by-eroding-the-basis-of-free-market-capitalism .Tags}

Doug **Bandow** (Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute and a former
Special Assistant to President Ronald Reagan) March 7, 19**97**: Freedom
and Virtue are Inseparable.
<http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=6186>.

For years [the Left promised that socialism would eventually out-produce
the market. That claim died with the Soviet Union. What remained of the
Left then began to complain that capitalism generated too many material
goods. Now similar attacks on capitalism are coming from the
Right]{.underline}. The market, it is said, threatens family, human
relationships, values and virtue. However, [it is a mistake to treat
freedom, which is the essence of capitalism, and virtue as mutually
antagonistic. In fact liberty\-- the right to exercise choice, free from
coercive state regulation\-- is a necessary precondition for
virtue]{.underline}. And [virtue is ultimately necessary for liberty to
flourish. Virtue cannot exist without the freedom to make moral
choices]{.underline}. [Coerced acts of conformity with some moral norm,
however good, do not represent virtue; rather, compliance with that
moral norm must be voluntary]{.underline}. [Virtue rejects a standard of
intra-personal morality]{.underline}. As such [it is an area that lies
largely beyond the reach of state power]{.underline}. Of course
societies can be more or less virtuous. But blaming moral shifts on
legal changes mistakes correlation for causation. America\'s one-time
cultural consensus eroded during an era of strict laws. Only cracks in
this consensus, which provided the moral foundation of the laws, led to
statutory changes. [Government has proved that it is not a good teacher
of virtue. The state tends to be effective at simple tasks, like jailing
people. It is far less successful in shaping individual consciences. New
laws would not make America a more virtuous nation. Even if there were
fewer overt acts of immorality, there would be no change in peoples
hearts and thus in society\'s moral core.]{.underline} Indeed
[attempting to forcibly make people virtuous would make society it self
less virtuous]{.underline}: [First individuals would lose the
opportunity to exercise virtue. They would not face the same set of
temptations and be forced to choose between good and evil. This approach
might make their lives a bit simpler. But they would not be more
virtuous]{.underline}. In this dilemma we see the paradox of
Christianity: A God of love creates man and provides a means of
redemption, but allows him to choose evil. [Second, to vest government
with primary responsibility for promoting virtue shortchanges other
institutions]{.underline} like the family and church, sapping their
vitality. [Private social institutions find it easier to lean on the
power of coercion than to lead by example, attempt to persuade and solve
problems. Third making government a moral enforcer encourages abuse by
whatever interest groups gain power. If one thing is certain, it is that
man is sinful. That sin is magnified by coercive power. Those who
possess power can]{.underline} of course, [do good, but history suggests
that they are far more likely to do harm]{.underline}. Indeed, as
Americas traditional Judeo-Christian consensus crumbles [we a more
likely to see government promoting alternative moral views. This is
possible only if the state is given the authority to coercively mold
souls in the name of the community or family. Despite the best
intentions of advocates of statecraft as soulcraft, government grows
ever more likely to enshrine something other than traditional
morality]{.underline}. [The fact that government can do little to help
does not mean that there is nothing it should do. Public officials
should adopt as their maxim \"First, do no harm.\"]{.underline}
[Although America\'s moral breakdown]{.underline}, most evident in the
inner-city, [has many causes, the welfare state has exacerbated the
problem at every level, punishing marriage, work and
thrift]{.underline}. Government has spent years attempting to expunge
religious values from the public square; the public school monopoly
discourages both good education and values instruction.

[Government grows]{.underline}, too[, because the subsidy given to one
group inspires others to demand the same benefits.]{.underline} And when
government protects one company or industry from competition, others
wonder why they shouldn\'t demand the same protection. That\'s why [no
government program ever stands still.]{.underline} No matter what the
stated purpose or limit when implemented, [it inevitably expands to
cover more and more]{.underline} people---and wider and wider areas.
Everyone who comes to the government asking for favors has a plausible
request. [Once it\'s considered proper to use government force to solve
one person\'s problem, force can be justified to solve anyone\'s
problem.]{.underline} Over time, [fewer and fewer requests seem out of
bounds.]{.underline} And the grounds for saying \"no\" become more and
more eroded. [The pressure on politicians to use coercion to grant
favors becomes overwhelming.]{.underline} The Motives of Public Servants
But, in truth, [very little pressure is needed.]{.underline} Lawmakers,
bureaucrats, and judges all rejoice in a government that grows and grows
and grows. [Big government gives lawmakers the power to make or break
companies and individuals]{.underline}. [People must bow]{.underline}
and scrape to obtain favors---[or just to keep government from
destroying them.]{.underline}

## Violations of liberty create a slippery slope to more governmental constraints.

Liberty and Hard Cases, p. \[xvii -- xix\]

We are not unfamiliar with the hazards of the slippery slope in our own
personal lives. [If a man hits his child in some]{.underline} alleged
[emergency, the very act of doing so may render him more amenable to
smacking the kid under more typical circumstanc]{.underline}es. Slapping
someone who is hysterical may make it easier to slap someone who is only
very upset or recalcitrant or annoying or just too slow fetching the
beer from the refrigerator. Similarly, [a "minor" breach of trust can
beget more of the same, a little white lie here and there can beget
lying as a routine]{.underline}, and so forth. [Moral habits promote a
principled course of action even in cases where bending or breaking the
principle might not seem too harmful to other parties or to our own
integrity]{.underline}. On the other hand, [granting ourselves
"reasonable" exceptions tends to weaken our moral habits]{.underline};
as we seek to rationalize past action, differences of kind [tend to
devolve into differences of degree. Each new exception provides the
precedent for the next, until we lose our principles altogether and
doing what is right becomes a matter of happenstance and mood rather
than of loyalty to enduring values. The same is true of public action.
When citizens of a country delegate to government,]{.underline} by means
of democratic and judicial processes, [the power to forge paternalistic
public policies such as banning drug abuse, imposing censorship,
restraining undesirable trade, and supporting desirable trade, the
bureaucratic and police actions increasingly rely on the kind of
violence and intrusiveness that no free citizenry ought to experience or
foster]{.underline}. And the [bureaucrats and the police tell
themselves]{.underline}, no doubt, [that what they're doing is perfectly
just and right.]{.underline} Consider, for starters, that when no one
complains about a crime---because it is not perpetrated against someone
but rather involves breaking a paternalistic law---to even detect the
"crime" requires methods that are usually invasive. Instead of charges
being brought by wronged parties, phone tapping, snooping, anonymous
reporting, and undercover work are among the dubious means that lead to
prosecution. Thus the role of the police shifts from protection and
peacekeeping to supervision, regimentation, and reprimand. No wonder,
then, that officers of the law are often caught brutalizing suspects
instead of merely apprehending them. Under a paternalistic regime, their
goals have multiplied, and thus the means they see as necessary to
achieving those goals multiply too. [The same general danger of
corrupting a free society's system of laws may arise when government is
called on to deal with calamities. There is the perception]{.underline},
of course, [that]{.underline} in such circumstances [the superior powers
of government are indispensable, given the immediateness of the
danger]{.underline}. The immediate benefits---a life saved by a
marine---are evident. [Yet the dangers of extensive involvement by legal
authorities in the handling of nonjudicial problems are no less
evident,]{.underline} if less immediate in impact.

## Government coercion causes more violations of liberty.

**Hazlitt**, founding board member of the Mises Institute and Journalist
for The Wall Street Journal, **07**

(Henry, Can the State Reduce Poverty? http://www.mises.org/story/2526)

[From the beginning of history,]{.underline} sincere
[reformers]{.underline} as well as demagogues [have sought to
abolish]{.underline} or at least to alleviate [poverty through state
action. In most cases their proposed remedies have only served to make
the problem worse. The most frequent]{.underline} and popular of these
proposed [remedies has been the simple one of seizing from the rich to
give to the poor. This remedy has taken a thousand different forms, but
they all come down to this. The wealth is to be \"shared,\"]{.underline}
to be \"redistributed,\" to be \"equalized.\" In fact, in the minds of
many reformers it is not poverty that is the chief evil but inequality.
[All schemes for redistributing]{.underline} or equalizing incomes or
wealth [must]{.underline} undermine or [destroy incentives at both ends
of the economic scale. They must]{.underline} reduce or [abolish the
incentives of the unskilled]{.underline} or shiftless [to improve their
condition by their own efforts]{.underline}; and [even the]{.underline}
able and industrious will see little point in earning anything beyond
what they are allowed to keep. These redistribution schemes must
inevitably reduce the size of the pie to be redistributed. They can only
level down. Their long-run effect must be to reduce production and lead
toward national impoverishment. [The problem we face is that the false
remedies for poverty are almost infinite in number. An attempt at a
thorough refutation of any single one of them would run to
disproportionate length. But some of these false remedies are so widely
regarded as real cures or mitigations of poverty that if I do not refer
to them I may be accused of having undertaken a book on the remedies for
poverty while ignoring some of the most obvious.]{.underline}

## Government coercion destroys the value to life and cannot be morally justified

Tibor Machan, PRIVATE RIGHTS & PUBLIC ILLUSIONS, 1995, p. 68-9.

All governmental action that does not serve to repel or retaliate
against coercion is antithetical to any respect for human dignity. While
it is true that some people should give to others to assist them in
reaching their goals, [forcing individuals]{.underline} to do so plainly
[robs them of their dignity. There is nothing morally worthwhile in
forced giving]{.underline}. Generally, for a society to respect human
dignity, [the special moral relations between people should be left
undisturbed. Government should confine itself to making sure that this
voluntarism is not abridged, no matter how tempting it might be to use
its coercive powers to attain some worthy goal.]{.underline}

## Coercion destroys value to life

Joseph **Raz**, philosopher, THE MORALITY OF FREEDOM, 19**86**, p. 307

One way to test the thesis of the primacy of action reasons is to think
of [a person who is entirely passive and]{.underline} is [continuously
led,]{.underline} cleaned, and pumped full with hash, so that he is
perpetually content, and wants nothing but to stay in the same
condition. It's a familiar imaginary horror. How do we rank the success
of such a life? It [is not the worst life one can have. It is simply not
a life]{.underline} at all. It lacks activity, it lacks goals. To the
extent that [one is tempted to]{.underline} judge it more harshly than
that and to [regard it as a 'negative life]{.underline}' this is
[because of]{.underline} the [wasted potentiality.]{.underline} It is [a
life which could have been and was not.]{.underline} We can isolate this
feature by imagining that the human being concerned is mentally and
physically effected in a way [which rules out the possibility of a life
with any kind of meaningful pursuit in it.]{.underline} Now [it
is]{.underline} just [not really a life at all.]{.underline} This does
not preclude one from saying that it is better than human life. It is
simply sufficiently unlike human life in the respects that matter that
we regard it as only [a degenerate case of human life]{.underline}. But
clearly [not being alive can be better]{.underline} than that life.

This, then, is an altogether different kind of understanding. Rather
than rescue humankind by freeing individuals from fear of death, this
perspective recommends educating people to the truth of an incontestable
relationship between death and geopolitics. [By surrendering ourselves
to States]{.underline} and to traditional views of self-determination,
[we encourage]{.underline} not immortality but [premature and
predictable extinction]{.underline}. It is a relationship that can, and
must, be more widely understood. There are great ironies involved.
[Although the corrosive calculus of geopolitics has now made possible
the deliberate killing of all life, populations all over the planet turn
increasingly to States for security.]{.underline} It is [the dreadful
ingenuity of States]{.underline} that [makes possible death in the
billions]{.underline}, but it is in the expressions of that ingenuity
that people seek safety. Indeed, [as the threat of nuclear annihilation
looms]{.underline} even after the Cold War, [the citizens of conflicting
States reaffirm their segmented loyalties]{.underline}, moved by the
persistent unreason that is, after all, the most indelible badge of
modern humankind.

## Coercion is the root cause of military conflict 

Dr. Mary J. **Ruwart,** PhD, former pharmaceutical research scientist,
former Assistant Professor of Surgery, HEALING OUR WORLD: THE OTHER
PIECE OF THE PUZZLE, 19**93**, p.
http://www.ruwart.com/Healing/ruwart_all.html.

[Humankind is]{.underline} poised [on the brink of an evolutionary leap.
In the last few decades, we have become increasingly aware of the source
of our inner peace]{.underline} and enrichment. Depending on our
personal background, we express this great discovery differently. The
practical, down-to-earth individuals among us \"take responsibility for
our lives\" as described in Wayne W. Dyer\'s Your Erroneous Zones. Those
of us with a metaphysical outlook \"create our own reality\" as Shirley
MacLaine did in Out on a Limb. The spiritual among us know that \"the
kingdom of God is within\" and follow The Road Less Traveled (M. Scott
Peck). Sometimes we simply \"find ourselves\" through the power of love
as Richard Bach did in The Bridge Across Forever. Ultimately, [our inner
harmony]{.underline} and abundance [depend on how we react to our outer
world. The creation of peace]{.underline} and plenty [in our outer
world]{.underline}, however, [frequently seems hopelessly beyond our
control.]{.underline} In the past century, we\'ve supported widespread
social reform. Nevertheless, people are still starving in a world
capable of feeding all. In our own country, homelessness and poverty are
on the rise. [Violence is no longer limited to overseas
wars]{.underline}: our streets, even our schools, are no longer safe.
The environment that nurtures us is ravaged and raped. [When we
acknowledge how our reactions contribute to our inner state, we gain
control. Our helplessness dissolves when we stop blaming others for
feelings we create.]{.underline} In our outer world, the same rules
apply. Today, as a society, [as a nation]{.underline}, as a collective
consciousness, [\"we\"]{.underline} once again [feel helpless, blaming
selfish others for the world\'s woes. Our nation\'s laws, reflecting a
composite of our individual beliefs, attempt to control selfish others
at gunpoint]{.underline}, if necessary. [Striving for a better world by
focusing on others instead of ourselves totally misses the mark. When
others resist the choices we have made for them, conflicts escalate and
voraciously consume resources. A warring world is a poor one. Attempting
to control others, even for their own good, has other undesirable
effects.]{.underline} People who are able to create intimacy in their
personal relationships know that you can\'t hurry love. Trying to
control or manipulate those close to us creates resentment and anger.
[Attempting to control others]{.underline} in our city, state, nation,
and world [is]{.underline} just as [destructive to the universal love we
want the world to manifest. Forcing people to be more \"unselfish\"
creates animosity instead of good will. Trying to control selfish others
is a cure worse than the disease.]{.underline} We reap as we sow. [In
trying to control others, we find ourselves controlled. We point fingers
at the dictators, the Communists, the politicians, and the international
cartels.]{.underline} We are blithely unaware that [our desire to
control selfish others creates and sustains them. Like a stone thrown in
a quiet pond, our desire to control our neighbors ripples outward,
affecting the political course of our]{.underline} community, state,
nation, and [world.]{.underline} Yet we know not what we do. [We attempt
to bend our neighbors to our will, sincere in our belief that we are
benevolently protecting the world from their folly]{.underline} and
short-sightedness. [We seek control to create peace and prosperity, not
realizing that this is the very means by which war and poverty are
propagated. In fighting for our dream without awareness, we become the
instruments of its destruction.]{.underline} If we could only see the
pattern! In seeking to control others, we behave as we once did as
children, exchanging our dime for five pennies, all the while believing
that we were enriching ourselves. When a concerned adult tried to
enlighten us, we first refused to believe the truth. Once awareness
dawned, we could no longer be fooled, nor was laborious deliberation
necessary for every transaction. Once we understood how to count money,
we automatically knew if we benefited from such a trade. Similarly, when
the fact and folly of controlling others first come to our attention,
we\'re surprised and full of denial. I certainly was! When we care about
the state of our world, however, we don\'t stop there. I trust you are
concerned enough to persevere and to consider seriously the shift in
consciousness this book proposes. [Once we have the courage to accept
responsibility for our part of the problem, we automatically become part
of the solution]{.underline}, independent of what others do. [We honor
their non-aggressive choices]{.underline} (even if they are self-ish)
[and stop trying to control them. In doing so, we dismantle their most
effective means of controlling *us*. Others only ignite the flames of
war and poverty. We feed the flames or starve them.]{.underline} Not
understanding their nature, we\'ve fanned the sparks instead of
smothering them. [Not understanding *our* contribution to the raging
inferno, we despair that a world full of selfish others could ever
experience universal har-mony and abundance.]{.underline} Nothing could
be further from the truth! [Widespread peace and plenty can be created
within our lifetime. When we understand how to stop fueling the flames
of war and poverty, we can manifest our dream.]{.underline}

**Coercion causes tyranny**.

Tibor **Machan**, philosophy professor, Auburn, PRIVATE RIGHTS AND
PUBLIC ILLUSIONS, 19**95**, p. 86-7

As Bondy notes, [in totalitarian states, where the government controls
the printing presses]{.underline} and publishing organizations, [anyone
wishing to state a personal opinion must gain official
sanction]{.underline}. (Even under Mikhail Gorbachev\'s glasnost and
perestroika reforms---begun in 1987, prior to the breakup of the Soviet
state---the openness and restructuring involved were permitted or
instituted by government, rather than being understood as a basic human
right that limits the scope and power of the government. Consider also
that General Augusto Pinochet\'s Chile had had a relatively \"free\"
market---that is, a government policy of abstention from heavy-handed
economic regulation. Yet its critics will quite rightly refuse to regard
it as having been a free country. Moreover in countries where
broadcasting is government administered, there is no right to telecast
one\'s views or ideas on the airways, only a permission to do so if it
suits the state authorities. In contrast, [if the right to property is
respected, individuals do not have to seek political permission to act,
even if they still must earn the opportunity to do so via the free
marketplace and in face of natural obstacles. The right to property is
the right to work for, acquire, and hold goods and valuables; it
includes the rights of production, trade, and bequest, as well as the
right to undertake innumerable actions vis-a-vis the world of ownable
items not even conceived of yet. The right to pursue happiness or
individual excellence in life, then, requires full support of the right
to property. Private property rights are neither favored nor legally
protected in our era and have not been for a long time.]{.underline}
Both cultural and legal developments in the last one hundred years have
undermined the protection of property rights [The state often acts in a
paternalistic fashion toward the citizen\'s ownership and management of
property. It is increasingly willing to usurp mutually agreed-upon
contracts]{.underline}. Nevertheless, broadly speaking, the history of
the United States demonstrates that the significant protection of
private property rights, despite much compromise and confusion, has a
propensity to increase the productivity as well as the
self-responsibility of the members of a human community. [It contributes
to their self-perception as moral agents who cannot expect others to
live for them and it fosters their concern for and development toward
doing reasonably well in their lives. In short, the right to private
property is a required feature of a human community that enhances human
flourishing.]{.underline}

## Global democratic consolidation is necessary to prevent many scenarios for war and extinction

OTHER THREATS This hardly exhausts the lists of threats to our security
and well-being in the coming years and decades. In the former Yugoslavia
nationalist aggression tears at the stability of Europe and could easily
spread. The flow of illegal drugs intensifies through increasingly
powerful international crime syndicates that have made common cause with
authoritarian regimes and have utterly corrupted the institutions of
tenuous, democratic ones. [Nuclear, chemical, and biological
weapons]{.underline} continue to [proliferate. The very source of
life]{.underline} on Earth, [the]{.underline} global [ecosystem, appears
increasingly endangered.]{.underline} Most of [these]{.underline} new
and unconventional [threats]{.underline} to security [are]{.underline}
associated with or [aggravated by the]{.underline} weakness or [absence
of democracy]{.underline}, with its provisions for legality,
accountability, popular sovereignty, and openness. LESSONS OF THE
TWENTIETH CENTURY The experience of this century offers important
lessons. [Countries that govern]{.underline} themselves [in
a]{.underline} truly [democratic fashion do not go to war with one
another.]{.underline} They do not aggress against their neighbors to
aggrandize themselves or glorify their leaders. [Democratic governments
do not ethnically \"cleanse\"]{.underline} their own populations, [and
they]{.underline} are much less likely to face ethnic insurgency.
Democracies [do not sponsor terrorism]{.underline} against one another.
[They do not build w]{.underline}eapons of [m]{.underline}ass
[d]{.underline}estruction to use on or to threaten one another.
Democratic countries form more reliable, open, and enduring trading
partnerships. In the long run they offer better and more stable climates
for investment. [They are]{.underline} more [environmentally responsible
because they must answer to]{.underline} their own [citizens, who
organize to protest the destruction of their environments.]{.underline}
They are better bets to honor international treaties since they value
legal obligations and because their openness makes it much more
difficult to breach agreements in secret. Precisely because, within
their own borders, they respect competition, civil liberties, property
rights, and the rule of law, democracies are the only reliable
foundation on which a new world order of international security and
prosperity can be built.

The reformers of [the Cambodian revolution claimed to be building a
better world.]{.underline} They forced people into reeducation programs
to make them better citizens. Then [they used force to
regulate]{.underline} every aspect of [commercial life.]{.underline}
Then they forced office workers and intellectuals to give up their jobs
and harvest rice, to round out their education. [When people resisted
having their lives turned upside down, the reformers had to use more and
more force. By the time they were done, *they had killed a third of the
country's population*, destroyed the lives of almost everyone still
alive]{.underline}, and devastated a nation. [It all began with using
force for the best of intentions---to create a better world. The Soviet
leaders used coercion to provide economic security and to build a "New
Man"---a human being who would put his fellow man ahead of himself. At
least 10 million people died to help build the New Man]{.underline} and
the Workers' Paradise. But human nature never changed---and the workers'
lives were always Hell, not Paradise. In the 1930s [many Germans gladly

\"Lao Tzu believed that [when people do not have a sense of power they
become resentful and uncooperative. Individuals who do not feel personal
power feel fear. They fear the unknown because they do not identify with
the world outside of themselves]{.underline}; thus [their psychic
integration is severely damaged and they are a danger to their society.
Tyrants do not feel power, they feel frustration and
impotency.]{.underline} They wield force, but it is a form of
aggression, not authority. On closer inspection, it becomes apparent
that individuals who dominate others are, in fact, enslaved by
insecurity and are slowly and mysteriously hurt by their own actions.
Lao Tzu [attribute]{.underline}d [most of the world\'s ills to the fact
that people do not feel powerful and independent.\"]{.underline}
Friedrich Nietzsche, the famous German philosopher, wrote that \"will to
power\" is the essence of human nature. In a book compiled from his
notes after his death, \'The Will To Power,\' is written: \"My idea is
that every specific body strives to be master over all space and to
extend its force (its will to power) and to thrust back all that resists
its extension. But it continually encounters similar efforts on the part
of other bodies and ends by coming to an arrangement (\"union\") with
those of them that are sufficiently related to it: Thus they conspire
together for power.\" .. [To feel that we are worthwhile individuals, to
know that we exist, we have to express our power - feel that we are in
control.]{.underline} This imperative to express our power and
experience control is central to human behavior. Every human does
something to express his or her power in the world. This power can be
expressed creatively or destructively. [Humans first attempt to express
their power creatively. If such attempts fail repeatedly, they
experience themselves as powerless.]{.underline} They may feel helpless
and hopeless, and become depressed. What they experience is that they
cannot make a positive difference in their own lives or in the world. A
cognitive breakdown occurs between their actions and the results they
produce. Mentally and intellectually they cease to understand the
connections between their behavior and the consequences of their
behavior. [Then they express their power destructively]{.underline}.

## Government coercion must be morally rejected

Recently (and ironically), government projects and programs have been
started to restore civil society through state subsidization or coercive
mandates. Such [coercion cannot create true voluntary associations.
Statists who support such projects believe only in the power of
political society -- they don\'t realize that the subsidized or mandated
activity can be performed voluntarily through the private interaction of
individuals and associations. They also don\'t understand that to
propose that an activity not be performed coercively, **is** not to
oppose the activity, but simply its coercion.]{.underline} [If civil
society is to be revived, we must substitute voluntary cooperation for
coercion and replace mandates with the rule of law.]{.underline}
According to the Cato Handbook for Congress, Congress should: before
trying to institute a government program to solve a problem, investigate
whether there is some other government program that is causing the
problem \... and, if such a program is identified, begin to reform or
eliminate it; ask by what legal authority in the Constitution Congress
undertakes an action \...; recognize that [when government undertakes a
program, it displaces the voluntary efforts of others and makes
voluntary association in civil society appear redundant, with
significant negative effects;]{.underline} and begin systematically to
abolish or phase out those government programs that do what could be
accomplished by voluntary associations in civil society \... recognizing
that [accomplishment through free association is morally superior to
coercive mandates, and almost always generates more efficient
outcomes.]{.underline} [Every time taxes are raised, another regulation
is passed, or another government program is adopted, we are
acknowledging the inability of individuals to govern themselves. It
follows that there is a moral imperative for us to reclaim our right to
live in a civil society, rather than to have bureaucrats and politicians
« solve » our problems and run our lives.]{.underline}

In Six Myths About Libertarianism, Murray N. [Rothbard
writes]{.underline}: \"If a person is forced by violence or the threat
thereof to perform a certain action, then it can no longer be a moral
choice on his part. [The morality of an action can stem only from its
being freely adopted; an action can scarcely be called moral if someone
is compelled to perform it]{.underline} at gunpoint. [Compelling moral
actions]{.underline} or outlawing immoral actions, therefore,
[cannot]{.underline} be said to [foster the spread of morality or
virtue]{.underline}. On the contrary, [coercion atrophies morality for
it takes away from the individual the freedom to be either moral or
immoral, and therefore forcibly deprives people of the chance to be
moral]{.underline}. [Paradoxically]{.underline}, then, [a compulsory
morality robs us of the very opportunity to be moral.]{.underline}

## Coercion violates fundament human rights

[www.libertyhaven.com/politicsandcurrente](http://www.libertyhaven.com/politicsandcurrente)
vents/politicalpartiesoractivism/essayoncaring.html

The Dividing Line A remarkable duality pervades the concept of caring
and its current implementation. Force represents the dividing line.
Application or refrain from coercion separates the wrongful intrusion
into the sanctity of the life of another from the permissible
compassionate endeavor. The law ought not impede attempts to aid others
or to solve problems where those enterprises occur without compulsion.
This should be true where the majority decries the problem as ridiculous
or the solution as ill-advised; after all, the crowd often proves
ineluctably wrong and, in any event, no human being possesses either the
ability or the moral privilege to substitute his judgment for that of
another choosing sentient being. Conversely, [no one should employ the
legal monopoly of force to compel adherence to, participation in, or
compliance with an artifice designed to better another, no matter how
well intentioned or meritorious the plan. No individual should be
permitted to thrust a decision]{.underline} or shunt responsibility for
the consequences of his choice [upon another, unwilling human
being]{.underline}. Disregard of this salient principle necessarily
denies the dignity of that other individual, since moral choice and
accountability constitute an essential element in the human condition.
Those who purport to care, then, must submit to a test of means and
motive. The law (rules and orders created and enforced by mankind)
should not address the means employed by those who promote compassion as
a political or economic discipline except to assure that no individual
or entity compels a dissenter to assent to, support or participate in a
proposal disagreeable to the latter for any reason.All too often, those
who preach caring, compassion and concern rest their case upon the root
of envy: Loathe the rich and trust the poor; take from the evil producer
and give to the high-principled but helpless victim of circumstance and
oppression. Such caring persons really do not care at all about others:
The creators must be plundered, the users must be pandered, by force and
violence, by false premises and promises, in order to salve the
promoter\'s inordinate ego and to effect his flawed view of mankind and
the world. In these, the vast majority of instances, one can always
count upon the concerned to care - -for themselves !

#  \*\*Property Rights Good\*\* {#property-rights-good .Block-Title-#1}

## Property rights are key to all rights.

John **Hospers**, Professor of Philosophy, University of Southern
California, THE LIBERTARIAN ALTERNATIVE, Tibor Machan, ed., 19**74**, p.
8.

Depriving people of property is depriving them of the means by which
they live-the freedom of the individual citizen to do what he wishes
with his own life and to plan for the future. Indeed, only if property
rights are respected is there any point to planning for the future and
working to achieve one\'s goals. Property rights are what makes
long-range planning possible - the kind of planning which is a
distinctively human endeavor, as opposed to the day-by-day activity of
the lion who hunts, who depends on the supply of game tomorrow but has
no real insurance against starvation in a day or a week. Without the
right to property, the right to life itself amounts to little: how can
you sustain your life if you cannot plan ahead? and how can you plan
ahead if the fruits of your labor can at any moment be confiscated by
government?

## Property rights critical to moral agency

Tibor **Machan**, philosophy professor, Auburn, PRIVATE RIGHTS AND
PUBLIC ILLUSIONS, 19**95**, p. 9-10

If one is on a desert island all by oneself, the issue of property
rights is of no significance, because there is no one else who could
threaten one\'s authority over what one is going to do and how one will
set out to manage the natural world that surrounds one. But if there is
somebody else---if, for example Robinson Crusoe is met by Friday---both
now have the choice to do good, bad, or mediocre deeds, and either may
have an impact on the other. They are moral agents who may get in each
other\'s way with their morally wrong choices and actions. In his choice
of ac­tions, for instance, Friday might help himself in a morally
significant fashion from which Crusoe ought not to benefit without
Friday\'s permission. There should be some way to tell what Robinson
Crusoe does and what Friday does and to let both of them have a say
whether and when they want to cooperate. This, in brief, spells out one
of the moral functions of [private property rights]{.underline}: Such
rights identify what Robert Nozick called [\"moral space\" around
persons---within which, if ad­equately protected, they can be sovereign
agents]{.underline} We can appreciate, then, that from the point of view
of morality [ev­eryone needs to know his or her proper scope of personal
authority and responsibility]{.underline}. One needs to know that some
valued item, skill, or liquid asset is in one\'s own jurisdiction to use
before one can be prudent, cre­ative, courageous, charitable, or
generous. [If one does not know that some particular area of human
concern is under one\'s own or other people\'s proper authority, then
one cannot know if it would be coura­geous]{.underline}, foolhardy, [or
silly to protect it]{.underline}, whether it would be generous or
reckless to share it, and so on. It follows that [private property
rights are]{.underline}, in the first place, [a social precondition to
the possibility of an extensive, personally guided, and morally
significant life]{.underline}. If one is to be generous to the starving
human beings in Somalia but has nothing of one\'s own from which to be
generous, generosity will not be possible So [there is, in effect, a
necessary connection between a practical moral code or set of guiding
moral prin­ciples and the institution of private property
rights]{.underline}.26

## Property rights are key to prevent Nazism.

Dr. Nathanial **Branden**, psychotherapist and author, INDIVIDUALISM AND
FREE SOCIETY**,** January 19**95**, p.
http://www.fff.org/freedom/0195d.asp

[The policy of seeking values from human beings by means of
force]{.underline}, when practiced by an individual, [is called crime.
When practiced by a government, it is called]{.underline} statism --- or
[totalitarianism]{.underline} or collectivism or communism or socialism
or nazism or fascism or the welfare state. Force, governmental
[coercion, is the instrument by which the ethics of
altruism]{.underline} --- the belief that the individual exists to serve
others --- [is translated into political reality]{.underline}. Although
this issue has not been traditionally discussed in the terms in which I
am discussing it here, the moral-political concept that forbids the
initiation of force, and stands as the guardian and protector of the
individual\'s life, freedom, and property, is the concept of rights. If
life on earth is the standard, [an individual has a right to live and
pursue values as survival requires]{.underline}; a right to think and
act on his or her judgment --- the right of liberty; a right to work for
the achievement of his or her values and to keep the results --- the
right of property; a right to live for his or her sake, to choose and
work for personal goals --- the right to the pursuit of happiness.
[Without property rights, no other rights are possible. We must be free
to use that which we have produced, or we do not possess the right of
liberty. We must be free to make the products of our work serve our
chosen goals, or we do not possess the right to the pursuit of
happiness]{.underline}. And --- since we are not ghosts who exist in
some nonmaterial manner --- we must be free to keep and consume the
products of our work or we do not possess the right of life. [In a
society where human beings are not free to own privately the material
means of production, their position is that of slaves whose lives are at
the absolute mercy of their rulers. It is relevant here to remember the
statement of Trotsky: \"Who does not obey shall not eat.\"]{.underline}

## Placing survival over individual autonomy replicates authoritarian regimes of control, subjugating individual rights to the values held by those in power  {#placing-survival-over-individual-autonomy-replicates-authoritarian-regimes-of-control-subjugating-individual-rights-to-the-values-held-by-those-in-power .Tags}

**Schroeder**, Prof. Law, Duke, **86**

(Christopher H. Schroeder, Prof. Law, Duke,1986, "Rights Against Risks,"
86 Colum. L. Rev. 495)

Actually, expanding the idea of preservation to include bodily integrity
on the basis of quality of life considerations has already pointed the
way to a more realistic statement of those individual characteristics
worth protecting. The same considerations of quality of life counsel
recognizing some freedom of action and initiative within the definition
of the morally relevant aspects of the individual. Doing so is
consistent with a long political and philosophical heritage. 90 Deeply
ingrained in practically all theories of the rights tradition is the
vision of a person as capable of forming and entitled to pursue some
individual life plan. 91 Given this vision, placing survival or bodily
integrity absolutely above all other ends would be tantamount to saying
that the life plan that one ought to adopt is that of prolonging life at
all costs. That idea is unacceptably authoritarian and regimented. It
would be extremely anomalous for a theory supposedly centered on the
autonomy of the individual to result in a conception of justice that
constrained all individuals to a monolithic result. Individual human
beings want more from their lives than simple \[\*520\] bodily
integrity, and the conception of an individual, of what defines and
constitutes a person, as so limited is peculiarly impoverished.
Individuals are capable of formulating and pursuing life plans, of
forming bonds of love, commitment, and friendship on which they
subsequently act, of conceiving images of self- and
community-improvement. Some of these may directly advance interests in
human survival, as when dedicated doctors and scientists pursue
solutions to cancer or develop chemical pesticides with a view to
assisting agricultural self-sufficiency in developing countries. Some
may dramatically advance the \"quality of life,\" rather than survival
itself, as when Guttenberg\'s press made literature more widely
available or when Henry Ford pioneered the mass production of the
automobile. However, even individual initiatives of much less
demonstrable impact on the lives of others constitute a vital element
that makes human life distinctively human. A just society ought to
understand and value this element both in the concrete results it
sometimes produces and in the freedom and integrity that are
acknowledged when individual liberty to conceive and act upon initiative
is respected.

**Rand**, Philosopher, **89**

A society that robs an individual of the product of his effort, or
enslaves him, or attempts to limit the freedom of his mind, or compels
him to act against his own rational judgment, a society that sets up a
conflict between it's ethics and the requirements of man's nature -- is
not, strictly speaking, a society, but a mob held together by
institutionalized gang-rule. Such a society destroys all values of human
coexistence, has no possible justification, and represents, not a source
of benefits, but the deadliest threat to man's survival. Life on desert
island is safer than and incomparably preferable than existence in
Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany.

**Callahan**, institute of Society and Ethics, **73**

(Daniel Callahan, institute of Society and Ethics, 1973, *The Tyranny of
Survival,* pp. 91-93)

The value of survival could not be so readily abused were it not for its
evocative power. But abused it has been. In the name of survival, all
manner of social and political evils have been committed against the
rights of individuals, including the right to life. The purported threat
of Communist domination has for over two decades fueled the drive of
militarists for ever-larger defense budgets, no matter what the cost to
other social needs. During World War II, native Japanese-Americans were
herded, without due process of law, to detention camps. This policy was
later upheld by the Supreme Court in Korematsu *v. United States* (1944)
in the general context that a threat to national security can justify
acts otherwise blatantly unjustifiable. The survival of the Aryan race
was one of the official legitimations of Nazism. Under the banner of
survival, the government of South Africa imposes a ruthless apartheid,
heedless of the most elementary human rights. The Vietnamese war has
seen one of the greatest of the many absurdities tolerated in the name
of survival: the destruction of villages in order to save them. But it
is not only in a political setting that survival has been evoked as a
final and unarguable value. The main rationale B. F. Skinner offers in
*Beyond Freedom and Dignity* for the controlled and conditioned society
is the need for survival. For Jacques Monod, in *Chance and Necessity*,
survival requires that we overthrow almost every known religious,
ethical and political system. In genetics, the survival of the gene pool
has been put forward as sufficient grounds for a forceful prohibition of
bearers of offensive genetic traits from marrying and bearing children.
Some have even suggested that we do the cause of survival no good by our
misguided medical efforts to find means by which those suffering from
such common genetically based diseases as diabetes can live a normal
life, and thus procreate even more diabetics. In the field of population
and environment, one can do no better than to cite Paul Ehrlich, whose
works have shown a high dedication to survival, and in its holy name a
willingness to contemplate governmentally enforced abortions and a
denial of food to surviving populations of nations which have not
enacted population-control policies. For all these reasons it is
possible to counterpoise over against the need for survival a \"tyranny
of survival.\" There seems to be no imaginable evil which some group is
not willing to inflict on another for sake of survival, no rights,
liberties or dignities which it is not ready to suppress. It is easy, of
course, to recognize the danger when survival is falsely and
manipulatively invoked. Dictators never talk about their aggressions,
but only about the need to defend the fatherland to save it from
destruction at the hands of its enemies. But my point goes deeper than
that. It is directed even at a legitimate concern for survival, when
that concern is allowed to reach an intensity which would ignore,
suppress or destroy other fundamental human rights and values. The
potential tyranny survival as value is that it is capable, if not
treated sanely, of wiping out all other values. Survival can become an
obsession and a disease, provoking a destructive singlemindedness that
will stop at nothing. We come here to the fundamental moral dilemma. If,
both biologically and psychologically, the need for survival is basic to
man, and if survival is the precondition for any and all human
achievements, and if no other rights make much sense without the premise
of a right to life---then how will it be possible to honor and act upon
the need for survival without, in the process, destroying everything in
human beings which makes them worthy of survival. To put it more
strongly, if the price of survival is human degradation, then there is
no moral reason why an effort should be made to ensure that survival. It
would be the Pyrrhic victory to end all Pyrrhic victories.

The utilitarian principle justifies intentional, harmful acts against
other humans to achieve a hoped-for benefit to a greater number of
people. It is the wrong approach to public policy decisions. Its most
notable proponents have been responsible for much of the misery and
strife of the last century. Experience has taught us time and again that
public servants, even when crafting policies that appear wholly
beneficent, can cause great harm (the so-called \"law of unintended
consequences\"). Humans lack the wisdom and foresight to completely
understand the future ramifications of many actions. A father, for
example, may believe that it is an entirely good thing to help his
daughter with homework every day because they are spending time together
and he is showing sincere interest in her life and schooling. By
\"helping\" with homework, however, his daughter may be denied the
mental struggle of searching for solutions on her own. She may not
develop the mental skills to solve tough math problems, for example, or
to quickly find key concepts in reading selections. If even \"good\"
actions can produce undesirable results, how much worse is the case when
evil is tolerated in the name of some conjectural, future outcome?

## Rights outweigh all -- critical to human dignitye future {#rights-outweigh-all-critical-to-human-dignitye-future .Tags}

George Kateb, Professor of Politics, Princeton, THE INNER OCEAN, 1992,
p. 405

Why make so much of individual personal and political rights? The
answer, as I have said, is that [respect for rights is the best way of
honoring human dignity]{.underline}. Why make so much of human dignity?
I do not find much to say. I am not even sure that much should be said.
Suppose we carry on at length about why governments should treat people
in certain ways (by actions and abstentions), and in these ways
unconditionally and as a matter of course, and should do so because
people deserve and are entitled to such treatment, rather than because
governments may find it prudent to treat people in these ways in the
spirit of extending revocable privileges. [I am afraid that we may
jeopardize human dignity by laboring to defend it]{.underline}. [What
sort of attack would merit an answer?]{.underline} Is a long and
elaborate theory needed to establish the point that people should not be
treated by the state as if they were masses, or obstacles or instruments
to higher purposes, or subjects for experiments, or pieces in a game, or
wayward children in need of protection against themselves, or patients
in need of perpetual care, or beasts in need of the stick? [With what
right does anyone maintain that people may be regarded or used in these
nonhuman]{.underline} or subhuman [ways?]{.underline} With what truth?
Unabused and undegraded, [people]{.underline} have always shown that
they deserve better. They [deserve guaranteed rights]{.underline}. When
their rights are respected, all that their dignity, their human status,
requires is achieved. People are enabled to lead lives that are free,
modest, and decent---provided, of course, socioeconomic circumstances
are not hopeless. To tie dignity to rights is therefore to say that
governments have the absolute duty to treat people (by actions and
abstentions) in certain ways, and in certain ways only. [The state\'s
characteristic domination and insolence are to be curbed for the sake of
rights]{.underline}. Public and formal [respect for rights]{.underline}
registers and [strengthens awareness]{.underline} of three constitutive
facts of being human: [every person is a creature capable of feeling
pain, and is a free agent capable of having a free being, of living a
life that is one\'s own and not somebody else\'s idea of how a life
should be lived, and is a moral agent capable of acknowledging that what
one claims for oneself as a right one can claim only as an equal to
everyone else]{.underline} (and relatedly that what one wants done to
oneself one should do to others). [Respect for rights recognizes these
capacities and thus honors human dignity.]{.underline}

## Policymakers must protect individual rights {#policymakers-must-protect-individual-rights .Tags}

George Kateb, Professor of Politics, Princeton, THE INNER OCEAN, 1992,
p. 2

The background assumption is that most people in a society of rights are
disposed to be law-abiding and that government\'s mere existence
sustains their disposition. But [because some persons inevitably
transgress against their fellow citizens, government can never lose the
status of protector; in particular, protector of life and property, the
usual objects of transgression]{.underline}. If, then, rights are rights
against the state, the theory of rights does not ignore the obvious fact
that the state exists to prevent, deter, or punish crime or mayhem. (I
prefer to see crime not as a denial of the victim\'s rights but,
instead, as legally culpable immorality; neverthe¬less, it is sometimes
sensible to speak of individuals violating one an¬other\'s rights.)
[Government exists to preserve individuals]{.underline}. The point is
that [it must do this work, and its other work, in a way that does not
violate rights, including the rights of transgressors and those accused
of transgression]{.underline}. If the Bill of Rights is the core, its
silences and deliberate omissions required that it be supplemented over
time. Freedom of speech, press, religion, and association; due-process
rights for suspects, defendants, and the legally guilty; and [respect
for a person\'s freedom]{.underline} from arbitrary invasions of
security and privacy---all [go far in protecting the dignity (or
integrity) of individuals]{.underline}. But their dignity needs
more---above all, three further rights: first, the right to vote and
take part in politics; second, the right to be spared from utter
degradation or to be saved from material misery; and third, the right to
equal protection of the laws (in the language of the Fourteenth
Amendment). The two last-named rights do not call for mere governmental
abstention, as do the rights of speech, press, religion, association,
security, and privacy. Nor do they call for only procedural justice, as
do some other main rights in the Bill of Rights. Rather, the right to be
free of degradation and misery Answers To a minimal samaritanism as
morally obligatory on society and looks to government to carry it out.
It is a right to be given something, to be enabled to begin to live a
life. Samaritanism is obligatory on society, and obligatory samaritanism
would be the foundation of a right to life which was expanded beyond its
present constitutional interpretation in the United States. I believe
that this right, more than any other, stands in need of expansion
through positive governmental action, despite all the serious risks
involved in charging governments with the task of fostering life. And
the equal protection of the laws may necessitate governmental action
against, say, official or social racial discrimination. Naturally, in
saying that [the state]{.underline}, which [must always be kept under
suspicion, must also be entrusted not only with the fundamental task of
preserving individuals against transgressors but also with the positive
function of promoting some of the rights that are indispensable to human
dignity]{.underline}, one admits that there will be an inevitable
ambivalence toward the state. It is an enemy, the worst enemy, but it is
not the only enemy and it is not only an enemy. My emphasis, however, is
on the antagonism that government shows to rights by its initiatives
rather than by its neglect. Throughout this book I rarely refer to
rights that need government\'s positive contribution. The latter rights,
no matter how fundamental, cannot be the norm in a society devoted to
individual rights. Different individuals may use or need the several
rights variably, but when government refuses to respect rights, it not
only makes people suffer, it injures everyone\'s human dignity.

I do not mean to take seriously the idea that utilitarianism is a
satisfactory replacement for the theory of rights. [The
well-being]{.underline} (or mere preferences) [of the majority cannot
override the rightful claims of individuals]{.underline}. In a time when
the theory of rights is global it is noteworthy that some moral
philosophers disparage the theory of rights. [The political experience
of this century should be enough to make them hesitate]{.underline}: it
is not clear that, say, some version of [utilitarianism
could]{.underline} not justify [totalitarian evil. It also could be
fairly easy for some utilitarians to justify any war and any
dictatorship, and very easy to justify any kind of ruthless-ness even in
societies that pay some attention to rights. There is no end to the
immoral permissions that]{.underline} one or another type of
[utilitarianism grants]{.underline}. [Everything is permitted, if the
calculation is right]{.underline}. No, [an advocate of rights cannot
take utilitarianism seriously as a competing general theory of political
morality]{.underline}, nor any other competing general theory. [Rather,
particular principles or considerations must be given a
place]{.underline}. A theory of rights may simply leave many decisions
undetermined or have to admit that rights may have to be overridden (but
never for the sake of Social well-being or mere policy preference).
Also, kinds of rights may sometimes conflict, and it is not always
possible to end that conflict either by an elaboration of the theory of
rights or by an appeal to some other

At the same time, there are other theories that seem to affirm human
dignity yet give rights only a lesser or probationary or instrumental
role. Examples are utilitarianism, recent communitarianism, recent
republicanism, and radical egalitarianism. The first and last 1 will
return to shortly; my response to the others appears here and there in
this volume. (All I wish to say now is that [unless rights come first
they are not rights. They will tend to be sacrificed to some purpose

They preach \"Democracy\" and then make a little addition---\"*Economic*
Democracy\" or a \"*Broader* Democracy\" or a \"*True* Democracy,\" and
demand that we turn all property over to the Government; \"all
property\" means also \"all rights\"; let everybody hold all rights
together---and nobody have any right of any kind individually. Is *that*
Democracy or is it Totalitarianism? You know of a prominent woman
commentator who wants us all to die for Democracy---and then defines
\"*true*\" Democracy as State Socialism \[*probably a reference to
Dorothy Thompson*\]. You have heard Secretary \[Harold\] Ickes define a
\"*true*\" freedom of the press as the freedom to express the views of
the majority. You have read in a highly respectable national monthly the
claim that the Bill of Rights, as taught in our schools, is \"selfish\";
that a \"*true*\" Bill of Rights means not demanding any rights for
*yourself*, but your giving these rights to \"*others*.\" God help us,
fellow-Americans, are we blind? Do you see what this means? Do you see
the implications? And this is the picture wherever you look. They
\"oppose\" Totalitarianism and they \"defend\" Democracy---by preaching
their own version of Totalitarianism, some form of \"collective good,\"
\"collective rights,\" \"collective will,\" etc. And the one thing which
is never said, never preached, never upheld in our public life, the one
thing all these \"defenders of Democracy\" hate, denounce and tear down
subtly, gradually, systematically---is the principle of Individual
Rights, Individual Freedom, Individual Value. *That* is the principle
against which the present great world conspiracy is directed. *That* is
the heart of the whole world question. That is the only opposite of
Totalitarianism and our only defense against it. Drop that---and what
difference will it make what name you give to the resulting society? It
will be Totalitarianism---and all Totalitarianisms are alike, all come
to the same methods, the same slavery, the same bloodshed, the same
horrors, no matter what noble slogan they start under, as witness Soviet
Russia and Nazi Germany.

## Sacrificing rights to preserve life produces totalitarianism.

Actually, [expanding the idea of preservation to include bodily
integrity on the basis of quality of life]{.underline} considerations
has already pointed the way to a more realistic statement of those
individual characteristics worth protecting. The same considerations of
quality of life counsel recognizing some freedom of action and
initiative within the definition of the morally relevant aspects of the
individual. Doing so [is consistent with a long political and
philosophical heritage.]{.underline} 90 Deeply ingrained in practically
all theories of the rights tradition is the vision of a person as
capable of forming and entitled to pursue some individual life plan. 91
Given this vision, [placing survival or bodily integrity absolutely
above all other ends would be tantamount to saying that the life plan
that one ought to adopt is that of prolonging life at all costs. That
idea is unacceptably authoritarian and regimented.]{.underline} It would
be extremely anomalous for a theory supposedly [centered on the autonomy
of the individual to result in a conception of justice that constrained
all individuals to a monolithic result]{.underline}. Individual [human
beings want more from their lives than]{.underline} simple \[\*520\]
[bodily integrity]{.underline}, and the conception of an individual, of
what defines and constitutes a person, as so limited is peculiarly
impoverished. Individuals are capable of formulating and pursuing life
plans, of forming bonds of love, commitment, and friendship on which
they subsequently act, of conceiving images of self- and
community-improvement. Some of these may directly advance interests in
human survival, as when dedicated doctors and scientists pursue
solutions to cancer or develop chemical pesticides with a view to
assisting agricultural self-sufficiency in developing countries. Some
may dramatically advance the \"quality of life,\" rather than survival
itself, as when Guttenberg\'s press made literature [more widely
available or when Henry Ford pioneered the mass production of the
automobile. However, even individual initiatives of much less
demonstrable impact on the lives of others constitute a vital element
that makes human life distinctively human.]{.underline} A just society
ought to understand and value this element both in the concrete results
it sometimes produces and in the freedom and integrity that are
acknowledged when individual liberty to conceive and act upon initiative
is respected.

All in all, then, I support the principled or rights-based ap­proach. In
normal contexts, [honesty is the best policy, even if at times it does
not achieve the desired good results; so is respect for every
individual\'s rights to life, liberty, and property. All in all, this is
what will ensure the best consequences---in the long run and as a rule.
Therefore, one need not be very concerned about the most recent estimate
of the consequences of banning or not banning guns, breaking up or not
breaking up Microsoft, or any other public policy, for that matter. It
is enough to know that violating the rights of individuals to bear arms
is a bad idea, and that history and analysis support our understanding
of principle. To violate rights has always produced greater damage than
good, so let\'s not do it, even when we are terri­bly tempted to do
so,]{.underline} Let\'s not do it precisely because [to do so would
violate the fundamental requirements of human na­ture.]{.underline} It is
those requirements that should be our guide, not some recent empirical
data that have no staying power (ac­cording to their very own theoretical
terms). Finally, you will ask, isn\'t this being dogmatic? Haven\'t we
learned not to bank too much on what we\'ve learned so far, when we also
know that learning can always be improved, mod­ified, even revised?
Isn\'t progress in the sciences and technology proof that past knowledge
always gets overthrown a bit later? As in science and engineering, so in
morality and politics: [We must go with what we know but be open to
change--- provided that the change is warranted. Simply because some
additional gun controls or regulations might save lives (some lives,
perhaps at the expense of other lives) and simply because breaking up
Microsoft might improve the satisfaction of con­sumers (some consumers,
perhaps at the expense of the satis­faction of other consumers) are no
reasons to violate basic rights.]{.underline} Only if and when there are
solid, demonstrable reasons to do so should we throw out the old
principles and bring on the new principles[. Any such reasons would have
to speak to the same level of fundamentally and relevance as that
incor­porated by the theory of individual rights itself.]{.underline}
Those defending consequentialism, like Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes,
have argued the opposite thesis: Unless one can prove, beyond a doubt,
that violating rights in a particular instance is necessarily wrong in
the eyes of a \"rational and fair man,\" the state may go ahead and
\"accept the natural outcome of dominant opinion\" and violate those
rights.1 Such is now the leading jurisprudence

[Ought Abrams to torture his mother to death in order to prevent the
threatened nuclear catastrophe?]{.underline} Might he not merely pretend
to torture his mother, so that she could then be safely hidden while the
hunt for the gang members continued? Entirely apart from the fact that
the gang could easily pierce this deception, [the main objection to the
very raising of such question s is the moral one that they seem to hold
open the possibility of acquiescing and participating in an unspeakably
evil project.]{.underline} To inflict such extreme harm on one\' s
mother would be an ultimate act of betrayal; in performing or even
contemplating the performance of such an action the son would lose all
self-respect and would regard his life as no longer worth living.\' [A
mother\' s right not to be tortured to death by her own son is beyond
any compromise. It is absolute . This absoluteness may be analyzed in
several different interrelated dimensions. all stemming from the supreme
principle of morality. The principle requires respect for the rights of
all persons to the necessary conditions of human action, and this
includes respect for the persons themselves as having the rational
capacity to reflect on their purposes and to control their behaviour in
the light of such reflection.]{.underline} The principle hence
[prohibits using any person merely as a means to the well-being of other
persons.]{.underline} For a son to torture his mother to death even 10
protect the lives of others would be an extreme violation of this
principle and hence of these rights, as would any attempt by others to
force such an action [. For this reason , the concept appropriate to it
is not merely \'wrong\' but such others as \'despicable\',
\'dishonorable\", \'base\', \'monstrous\']{.underline}. In the scale of
moral modalities , such concepts function as the contrary extremes of
concepts like the supererogatory , What is supererogatory is not merely
good or right but goes beyond these in various ways; it includes saintly
and heroic actions whose [moral merit surpasses what is strictly
required of agents]{.underline}, In parallel fashion, what is base,
dishonourabte. or despicable is not merely bad or wrong but goes beyond
these in moral demerit since it subverts even the minimal worth or
dignity both of its agent and of its recipient and hence, the basic
presupposition s of morality itself, Just as the supererogatory is
superlatively good, so the despicable is superlatively evil and
diabolic, and its moral wrongness is so rotten that a morally decent
person will not even consider doing it. [This is but another way of
saying that the rights it would violate must remain
absolute.]{.underline}

Reconstruction." Princeton University Press. Philosophy & Public Affairs
31, No. 3, Pg 16. Project MUSE.

In order to advance the reconstruction of the Hierarchy Argument, we
must now answer the following question: [How does this highest-order
interest in rationality and its preconditions justify the lexical
priority of the basic liberties over other primary goods, as called for
by the Priority of Liberty? In short, it justifies such priority because
**the basic liberties *are* necessary conditions for the exercise of
rationality**]{.underline}**,** which is why parties in the Original
Position "give first priority to preserving their liberty in these
matters" (pp. 131--32). [If the parties were to sacrifice the basic
liberties for the sake of other primary goods (the "means that enable
them to advance their other desires and ends" \[p. 476\]), they would be
sacrificing their highest-order interest in rationality and its
preconditions, and thereby failing to express their nature as autonomous
beings (p. 493).]{.underline} A brief examination of the basic liberties
enumerated by Rawls will indicate why they are necessary conditions for
the exercise of rationality (p. 53). [The freedoms of speech and
assembly, liberty of conscience, and freedom of thought are essential to
the creation and revision of plans of life: without secure
rights]{.underline} to explore ideas and beliefs with others (whether in
person or through various media) and consider these at our leisure, [we
would be unable to make informed decisions about our conception of the
good. Freedom of the person (including psychological and bodily
integrity), as well as the right to personal property and immunity from
arbitrary arrest and seizure, are necessary to create a stable and safe
personal space for purposes of reflection and communication, without
which rationality would be compromised if not crippled. **Even small
restrictions on these basic liberties would threaten our highest order
interest**, however slightly, and such a threat is disallowed given the
absolute priority of this interest over other concerns.]{.underline}
Note also that lexical priority can be justified here for all of the
basic liberties, not merely a subset of them (as was the case with the
strains-of-commitment interpretation of the Equal Liberty of Conscience
Argument).1

[The right to health, like the right to bodily integrity, is related to
but not whol1y based on the right to life.]{.underline} Ill health and
mutilation of the body need not threaten life. [Deliberately to harm the
health of persons is to violate their personhood, impairing capacities,
causing needless suffering, overriding wills.]{.underline} So too with
violation of bodily integrity, as with compulsory sterilization,
barbarous forms of punishment such as chopping off hands, blinding,
removing the tongue. In a real sense, although not in the sense
suggested in Locke\'s labor argument for private property nor in the
sense claimed by many feminists in their defense of abortion from a
woman\'s right to control (and mutilate?) her body, our body is ours to
care for and maintain as the vehicle of our personhood. Although it is
true that we can lose an organ, a leg, an eye, and still be the same
person, our body appertains to us as persons. [The negative aspect of
the case for the rights to health and bodily integrity is evidently
strong. How can another have the right to injure, infect, disease a
person? So to act is to violate a right. A very powerful moral
justification would be necessary for such an act not to constitute a
grave end illegitimate violation of a right.]{.underline}

Even in the richest states, budgetary limitations often lead to sharp
confrontations between pressure groups and vested interests in various
social, economic, and cultural domains. [Using the term
"human]{.underline} rights" to describe one's interests does not change
this fact of real-world limits. Rather, it [creates the risk of
inflating political rhetoric and passion, now]{.underline} that [the
flag of human]{.underline} rights [flies over almost the whole arena of
government policy. Each policy option can be interpreted at one and the
same time as both a measure to further some human right and as an
indication of the neglect or even violation of any number of other
human]{.underline} rights. Therefore, [there is at all times unlimited
room for weighing various "]{.underline}rights[" and for setting and
revising priorities. The political and administrative bodies to which
this weighing of]{.underline} rights [has been entrusted or that have
succeeded in monopolising it have ample opportunities for expanding
their power and influence]{.underline}. Nothing remains of the old idea
that a right is worthy of respect in all circumstances except, perhaps,
the most extreme emergency. [The human rights of the UD are not and
cannot be absolute, even in the most normal of circumstances---unless
anything short of Utopia should count as an emergency. By their very
nature, they are susceptible to continuous weighing, negotiation, and
qualification. They are a politician's delight, for every human right
translates into "a right to more government intervention on its
behalf]{.underline}." This is no less true for the ghosts of natural
rights that linger in the first half of the UD than for the economic,
social, and cultural "rights" in the rest of it. Of course, we should
not confuse the ghost and the real thing. For example , Article 2 of the
French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen clearly states what
a person's natural rights *are*: liberty, property, freedom from
arbitrary arrest, and resistance to oppression. In the UD, on the other
hand, a person is not informed that his life, liberty, security of
person, and property *are* his fundamental rights. He is told only that
he has the right to life, liberty, and security of person (Art. 3) and
property (Art. 17). He should not expect more. For it is obviously
inconsistent to claim that everyone is entitled to the full realisation
of the economic, social, and cultural "rights" and at the same time to
claim that any person's fundamental rights are *his* life, liberty, and
property. [The administration of the former requires the concentration
of massive coercive powers of taxation and regulation in the hands of
the state, and so must presuppose that a person's life, liberty, and
property are *not* his rights]{.underline}. However, [this inconsistency
evaporates once we realise that the UD's "rights to life, liberty,
property" do not specify to *whose* life, liberty, or property a person
has a right. It rules out]{.underline} the possibility that he [has an
exclusive right to]{.underline} *his own* [life, liberty, or property,
but it *does not* rule out that some or all others have an equal, or
perhaps more pressing, claim on those things in order to enable them,
say, to enjoy the arts or a paid holiday]{.underline}. Thus, [a person's
life, liberty, and property are thrown upon the enormous heap of
desirable scarce resources to which all people are said to have a
right]{.underline}. As such, [they]{.underline}, too, [end up in the
scales with which political authorities, administrators, and experts are
supposed to weigh the ingredients for their favoured
policy-mix]{.underline}. Here we catch our first glimpse of the shadow
of Hobbes behind the contemporary notion of human rights: the person who
believes he has "a right to everything" is likely to find out that there
is no thing that is his right. A Hobbesian Predicament The following
thought experiment will bring out the Hobbesian character of the UD's
conception of human rights. [Imagine two people, the only survivors of a
shipwreck, who find refuge on a small deserted island. They have with
them nothing but their human rights,]{.underline} in particular their
"right to work" and all that it entails according to Articles 23, 24,
and 25 of the UD. [One can imagine what will happen if they sit there
insisting on their "right]{.underline}" of being employed by the other
at a just and favourable wage, or to receive an unemployment
compensation high enough to allow them an existence worthy of their
dignity. One can also imagine what will happen if, [instead of just
sitting there, they attempt to enforce their human rights against one
another: their own version of Hobbes's war of all against
all.]{.underline} Finally, [one can easily imagine what would happen if
one of them won that war: Hobbes's solution for the incompatibility of
their "rights" would emerge. The winner could then arrange
for]{.underline} himself [a nice unemployment compensation]{.underline}
(e.g., a tax on an-other's labour) [to match]{.underline} his [new-found
dignity as a ruler, and keep the other]{.underline} man [quiet by
leaving]{.underline} him [as much as is consistent with "the
organisation and the resources of their state]{.underline}." Indeed,
[starvation, universal war, and the Leviathan State are the only
possible outcomes under a regime of human rights]{.underline}---and only
the latter outcome is compatible with survival. [Imagining a two-person
situation makes this conclusion clear, but its validity does not depend
on the numbers. Large numbers only serve to obscure the logic of the
situation]{.underline}. the burden of taxation and regulation just below

## Limiting government protection to property rights is key to prevent atrocities

Edward Feser, philosophy professor, Loyola, ON NOZICK, 2004, p. 89-90.

That last line of the last chapter no doubt scandalizes many readers, as
does the conception of politics it evinces. "[Surely there is more to
morality than property rights]{.underline}, and more to social life than
exchanging property!" they might be tempted to respond; "And surely
there is more to community than the collective safeguarding of that
property! What a cold and heartless --- indeed, positively counter-
utopian ---conception of human life is embodied by such a view!" [They
would, of course, be absolutely right to think this]{.underline}. Where
they go wrong is in assuming that Nozick would think, or is required by
his position to think, any differently in assuming that Nozick's
political philosophy is intended to be a complete social philosophy.
[They go wrong also in assimilating "morality" to justice, "social life"
to politics, and "community" to government]{.underline}. For [justice is
not the whole of morality; not all of social life is politics; and
genuine human community definitely is not the same thing as government
action]{.underline}. Justice the securing of which is the chief end of
political action --- is, however important, but one virtue among others.
Sometimes what is called "justice" is not justice at all, but a mask for
something decidedly unvirtuous, such as envy. One suspects that the
demand for equality is a case in point; certainly one suspects this when
one considers that equality as an ideal is rarely argued for by it
proponents, and is almost never argued for very well (Nozick 1974.
chapter 8). [There are, in any case, virtues that are as important as
justice, and some that are more important]{.underline}. Temperance,
prudence. fortitude, faith, hope, and love are cases in point, and only
a fool could believe that the practice of these virtues will be
guaranteed if only we hit upon the right government program.
[Government]{.underline} itself, however high-flown the rhetoric often
spouted in its defense, [is]{.underline}, it must always be remembered,
[nothing more than brute force]{.underline}, [the getting of people to
do things or to refrain from doing things by the threat of
violence]{.underline}. Sometimes, as when the defense of individual
rights is involved, such force is necessary; it remains force
nonetheless. And [when it involves the imposition of redistributive
taxation or paternalistic regulation, it involves nothing more than some
people forcing other people --- innocent people who have violated no one
else's rights --- to do things against their will]{.underline}, to
submit to the will of those doing the forcing. [Whether or not one
thinks such arm-twisting is morally justified, it is dishonest, indeed
perverse, to talk smugly as if it is the quintessence of
"community]{.underline}." Nor can politics --- which in a
non-libertarian society amounts to little more than the struggle to be
the ones who get to force the others, even if "for their own good" ---
plausibly be regarded as a paradigmatically social activity, at least
not if "social" is meant to connote an ideal of high-minded cooperation.
[A conception of human life that sees all questions of morality, and
indeed everything of value, as necessarily entailing a political program
backed by the police power of the state and the threat of litigation, is
one that can only be described, charitably, as deficient; less
charitably, as warped]{.underline}. We need, in Nozick's view, to learn
"to see through the political realm" (1974, x). We need to get beyond
the tendency --- a very modern tendency that would have surprised
earlier generations --- reflexively to think of all problems as having a
political solution, of all progress as dependent on government action.
[We need in particular to stop thinking in utopian terms---or rather, to
stop thinking of utopia in political terms]{.underline}. [The utopias of
the past have usually been implemented in a political fashion, and they
have universally failed, often catastrophically --- think the French
Revolution, Auschwitz, the Gulag]{.underline} Archipelago. They have
also involved the imposition of one group's vision of utopia on everyone
(indeed, this is part of the reason why they have failed). If utopian
thinking is to be realistic and to have a future, it must avoid these
errors.

As choices like these seem to become more common, i.e., choices between
risk alternatives presented in terms of probability estimates, it is not
surprising if people in general feel more and more insecure despite the
fact that we lead longer and healthier lives now than we did a couple of
centuries ago. The solution, however, is not to spare lay people from
making risk decisions or letting experts make the decisions for them. In
this thesis it is argued that the risk-exposed should be included in the
decision procedure. Moreover, this procedure should be open to other
aspects than those that a narrow technical framing allows for.
Respecting a variety of aspects may not make risk decisions easier to
make, but as these decisions are in fact seldom easily made, being
honest about that may relieve some of the feelings of anxiety and
distrust among the general public. Background and aim of thesis Risk
management is frequently described as a practice in crisis. Critics
point to investigations analysing several countries' risk expenditures
which have shown large variations in the cost per statistical life saved
in different social sectors. The differences are said to be the result
of arbitrary decisions. Furthermore, it is argued that if societal
resources were used in a more effective and rational way, these
differences could be levelled out and more lives be saved for the same
amount of money. Therefore, demands for a consistent risk management
have repeatedly been called for in the risk literature (See e.g. Morone
& Woodhouse, 1986; Morrall, 1986; Viscousi, 1996; Breyer, 1999; Sjöberg
1999; Sunstein, 2002). In technical discussions about risk it has been
maintained that risks should be managed in accordance with scientific
data in order to avoid the irrational fears of the public, whose focus
is on sensational risks, while the real, but more ordinary risks, go
unnoticed. Risk management should be a rational, neutral, and scientific
area beyond the influence of emotions, ideologies and values. One such
approach is the Standard Model that is discussed in this thesis (see
especially articles I and II). According to this model a risk is defined
as the probability of a negative event multiplied by the damage
resulting from it, for instance expected fatalities. The number
representing the risk is weighed against the possible benefit that could
be gained from accepting it. If total benefit exceeds total cost (risk),
then the risk can be accepted. In this thesis I argue that scientific
and technological reasoning is not enough for analysing or managing
risks. Even though the Standard Model contributes to a systematic way to
make risk decisions, it is too narrow a perspective on risk management.
Such a narrow perspective may allow for risk exposure that violates the
rights of the individual. While I agree that consistency in risk
decisions is valuable and worth striving for, I question the standard
approach to how this should be done and maintain that a new and wider
perspective on how to understand consistency in risk management needs to
be developed. Above all, it is argued that the current "price-tag
thinking" (i.e., that consistency in risk management is exclusively
about costs for different kinds of risk reductions) is insufficient.

## Utilitarianism doesn't trump the impact of coercion---individuals can't be reduced to units of value. {#utilitarianism-doesnt-trump-the-impact-of-coercionindividuals-cant-be-reduced-to-units-of-value.-1 .Tags}

Machan, 95 Professor of philosophy, Auburn University, 1995 (Tibor,
PRIVATE RIGHTS AND PUBLIC ILLUSIONS, 1995, p. 129)

The essential point to note at this juncture is how the idea of the
worth and rights of the individual simply cannot find a place in the
standard utilitarian cost-benefit analysis favored by many economists.
Benefits, according to this approach, are to be measured by what people
prefer (or would prefer, if properly informed), while costs are
reducible to what people would prefer to do without or avoid if they
were properly informed. The kind of value (or worth) individuals have,
however, is not just one benefit competing among other
benefits\...Consider the case where some people are injured or harmed by
others. \"Since the costs of injury are borne by its victims,\" Kelman
contends, \"while its benefits are escaped by its perpetrators, simple
cost-benefit calculations may be less important than more abstract
conceptions of justice, fairness, and human dignity. Developing this
theme more fully, Kelman writes as follows: *We would not condone a rape
even if it could be demonstrated that the rapist derived enormous
pleasure from his actions, while the victim suffered in only small
ways*. Behind the conception of \"rights\" is the notion that some
concept of justice, fairness or human dignity demands that individuals
ought to be able to perform certain acts, despite the harm of others,
and ought to be protected against certain acts, despite the loss this
causes to the would-be perpetrator. Thus we undertake no cost-benefit
analysis of the effects of freedom of speech or trial by jury before
allowing them to continue.

Anscombe, 93 Professor of Philosophy, Cambridge University, Absolutism
and Its Consequentialist Critics, edited by Joram Graf Haber, p. 51-52.

Common morality is outraged by the consequentialist position that, as
long as human beings can remain alive, the lesser of two evils is always
to be chosen. Its defenders maintain, on the contrary, that there are
minimum conditions for a life worthy of a human being, and that nobody
may purchase anything- not even the lives of a whole community- by
sacrificing those conditions. A community that surrenders its members at
the whims of tyrants ceases to be anything properly called by that name;
and individuals willing to accept benefits at the price of crimes
committed upon other individuals degrade their humanity. Common morality
allows a certain room for compliance with tyrannical external force,
when resistance has become impossible; but there is a line that must be
drawn beyond which compliance is excluded, and the example of rabbinic
teaching is a guide drawing it.

Utilitarianism conceives of rights as being cognizable only when they
are legally recognized.
[236](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n236#n236)
To the utilitarian, there is no such thing as a moral right because it
is not socially recognized.
[237](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n237#n237)
The utilitarian rejection of moral rights can be fatal to affirmative
action. Rights in utilitarian rhetoric are synonymous with the idea of a
valid claim to act.
[238](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n238#n238)
Put differently, one can be said to hold a valid claim when, and only
when, that claim is grounded in a legally or socially recognized right.
This normative theory of rights further posits that the exercise of
rights is not dependent upon a duty incumbent upon others to acknowledge
or respect that right.
[239](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n239#n239)
This is clearly problematic when applied to calls for affirmative
action. Instead of conceiving of rights as corresponding with a duty,
the utilitarian thinks of rights in terms of \"immunity rights,\" which
have a corresponding concept of a \"disability.\"
[240](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n240#n240)
This too is a foreboding concept because affirmative action programs
often involve affirmative guarantees, versus a simple right to be free
from discrimination. An example of an immunity right is the right to
free speech. The right to free speech exists independently of an
obligation upon others not to interfere with an individual\'s right to
exercise free speech.
[241](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n241#n241)
The corresponding disability operates upon Congress. The disability
prohibits Congress from enacting certain laws abridging the
individual\'s right to free speech, but does not extend so far as to
require the passage of legislation which would affirmatively protect or
guarantee the immunity right.
[242](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n242#n242)
The immunity right, then, is one that merely involves a freedom from
outside interference, a sort of negative right, as opposed to being a
right that is affirmatively protected through the imposition of an
obligation upon others to honor the right. The distinction made between
moral and legal rights, encompassing the distinction between a
disability and a duty, is central to the utilitarian argument.
Utilitarianism squarely rejects the recognition of moral rights because
moral rights must be understood in terms of a corresponding beneficial
obligation.
[243](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n243#n243)
A moral conception of rights dictates that a right is held by an
individual \"if and only if one is supposed to benefit from another
person\'s compliance with a coercive\...rule.\"
[244](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n244#n244)
Utilitarianism must necessarily reject a conception of rights grounded
in morality because the utilitarian doctrine is diametrically opposed to
the notion that rights correspond with duties. \[\*563\] Furthermore,
utilitarianism renounces moral rights precisely because they exist
independent of social recognition or enforcement.
[245](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n245#n245)
Moral rights \"are independent of particular circumstances and do not
depend on any special conditions,\"
[246](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n246#n246)
like legal affirmation. Thus, moral rights cannot be accepted by the
utilitarian because they lack the normative grounding fundamental to
utilitarian theory. Utilitarians, therefore, assume that there is a
clear delineation between moral rights and the pursuit for overall human
welfare, the central tenet of utilitarian doctrine.

## Utilitarianism fundamentally fails to protect individual rights -- "greatest good" claims simply conflict. {#utilitarianism-fundamentally-fails-to-protect-individual-rights-greatest-good-claims-simply-conflict. .Tags}

Erin Byrnes, JD U Arizona, 1999, "Therapeutic Jurisprudence: Unmasking
White Privelege to Expose the Fallacy of White Innocense," 41 *Ariz. L.
Rev.* 535

Moral rights are objectionable not only because they lack social
recognition but also because they necessarily imply a correlation
between rights and duties. Again, utilitarianism\'s specific rejection
of the tie between rights and duties renders recognition of white
privilege nearly impossible. Without this recognition, there can be no
meaningful solution.
[247](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n247#n247)
If accepted, moral rights would provide the grounds for the appraisal of
law and other social institutions, a system of appraisal antithetical to
utilitarianism\'s rubric of assessment. Moral rights carry with them the
expectation that institutions will be erected with an eye towards
respect and furtherance of such rights.
[248](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n248#n248)
Such a proposition would certainly require more than just striving
towards color-blindness were it applied to affirmative action.
Utilitarianism, however, requires that institutions and rights be
evaluated solely with respect to the promotion of human welfare, welfare
being the satisfaction of overall citizen desires.
[249](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n249#n249)
The assumption, implicit in the foregoing argument, is that moral rights
neither fit perfectly nor converge with legal rights.
[250](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n250#n250)
This may not necessarily be the case. David Lyons\' \"theory of moral
rights exclusion\" discusses the way in which utilitarians conceive of
moral rights working at odds with the utilitarian goal.
[251](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n251#n251)
Lyons\' theory describes the way in which a moral right, at some point,
gains enough currency to warrant individual exercise of that right.
According to Lyons, when a moral right has reached this point, it has
achieved the \"argumentative threshold\" and gains normative force.
[252](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n252#n252)
The potential for this occurrence is precisely what leads to the
utilitarian rejection of moral rights. Rejection is predicated on the
fact that once the argumentative threshold is reached, a presumption is
created against interference upon the individual exercise \[\*564\] of
the right.
[253](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n253#n253)
Under a system which recognized moral rights, but still organized itself
according to the utilitarian goal of achieving human welfare (which is
happiness), individual rights would purportedly run headlong into the
pursuit of welfare.
[254](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n254#n254)
Though the pursuit of welfare would be deemed morally relevant and would
justify a course of action on welfare\'s behalf, in a scenario where
that course of action constituted a mere \"minimal increment of
utility,\" it would be incapable of overcoming the argumentative
threshold of rights.
[255](http://www.lexis.com/research/retrieve?_m=6086918c24ac435052e6f504fe73f06f&docnum=5&_fmtstr=FULL&_startdoc=1&wchp=dGLbVzb-zSkAt&_md5=43416a79a379e0b157709063cbfc7fc5&focBudTerms=SUMMARY%20%2528utilitar%2521%20w/20%20righ%2521%20%2529&focBudSel=all#n255#n255)
Thus, the argument is that the recognition of moral rights is
diametrically opposed to utilitarianism because in a moral rights
regime, rights act as a limitation upon the utilitarian goal of
fulfilling as many individual desires as possible.

## Utilitarianism reduces individuals to their mere utility value, making them expendable {#utilitarianism-reduces-individuals-to-their-mere-utility-value-making-them-expendable .Tags}

Christopher H. Schroeder, Prof. Law, Duke,1986, "Rights Against Risks,"
86 Colum. L. Rev. 495

The anxiety to preserve some fundamental place for the individual that
cannot be overrun by larger social considerations underlies what H.L.A.
Hart has aptly termed the \"distinctively modern criticism of
utilitarianism,\" 58 the criticism that, despite its famous slogan,
\"everyone \[is\] to count for one,\" 59 utilitarianism ultimately
denies each individual a primary place in its system of values. Various
versions of utilitarianism evaluate actions by the consequences of those
actions to maximize happiness, the net of pleasure over pain, or the
satisfaction of desires. 60 Whatever the specific formulation, [the goal
of maximizing some measure of utility obscures and diminishes the status
of each individual]{.underline}. [It reduces the individual to a
conduit, a reference point that registers the appropriate \"utiles,\"
but does not count for anything independent of his monitoring
function.]{.underline} 61 [It also produces moral requirements that can
trample an individual, if necessary, to maximize utility, since once the
net effects of a proposal on the maximand have been taken into account,
the individual is expendable]{.underline}. Counting pleasure and pain
equally across individuals is a laudable proposal, but counting only
pleasure and pain permits the grossest inequities among individuals and
the \[\*509\] trampling of the few in furtherance of the utility of the
many. In sum, utilitarianism makes the status of any individual
radically contingent. [The individual\'s status will be preserved only
so long as that status contributes to increasing total utility.
Otherwise, the individual can be discarded.]{.underline}

## Calculation of human life leads to no value to life and the zero point of the holocaust {#calculation-of-human-life-leads-to-no-value-to-life-and-the-zero-point-of-the-holocaust .Tags}

Michael Dillon, Prof. Politics U-Lancaster, 04-1999, *Political Theory,*

Economies of evaluation necessarily require calculability. Thus no
valuation without mensuration and no mensuration without indexation.
Once rendered calculable, however, units of account are necessarily
submissible not only to valuation but also, of course, to devaluation.
Devaluation, logically, can extend to the point of counting as nothing.
Hence, no mensuration without demensuration either. There is nothing
abstract about this: the declension of economies of value leads to the
zero point of holocaust. However liberating and emancipating systems of
value-rights-may claim to be, for example, they run the risk of counting
out the invaluable. Counted out, the invaluable may then lose its
purchase on life. Herewith, then, the necessity of championing the
invaluable itself. For we must never forget that, \"we are dealing
always with whatever exceeds measure.\" But how does that necessity
present itself? Another Justice answers: as the surplus of the duty to
answer to the claim of Justice over rights. That duty, as with the
advent of another Justice, is integral to the lack constitutive of the
human way of being.

Hardin\'s solution would be reasonable if it could be assumed that the
majority is aware of threats to the commons and knows the measures
needed to prevent its destruction. But this is the very knowledge which
Hardin asserts individuals lack. Individual \"rationality,\" or
self-interest, Hardin says, is what leads to the destruction of the
commons. How self- interested individuals are to be transformed into a
public-spirited, wise majority is a problem Hardin does not address. The
knowledge required to use the commons wisely will not result
automatically from the majority\'s power to impose its will on the
minority. Hardin also ignores the possibility that the majority might
act un- justly; that is, coerce the minority for its own immediate
pleasure rather than for the preservation of the commons and the
well-being of future generations. That mutual coercion might degenerate
into majority tyranny is a possibility that Hardin does not acknowledge,
nor does his prescription provide a solution.46

Heilbroner\'s argument leads to a similar predicament. As pessimistic as
he is in Inquiry Into the Human Prospect, he does see hope that the
psychological need for authority-the \"trait of obedience\"-will be
powerful enough to force men to acquiesce to authoritarian controls
before it is too late.47 Heilbroner doubts that men will consent to the
authority of reason or engage in discussion about the need for govern-
ment. He predicates his only hope for survival on a government which
presupposes the unwillingness if not the incapacity of men to exercise
reason. For Heilbroner the Hobbesian fear of violent death at the hands
of one\'s fellow man is the fear of extinction from environmental de-
struction. In both cases salvation is sought in the coercive power of
the Leviathan. Ironically, it was the unleashing of the passion for
material abundance, legitimized by Hobbesian natural right, amplified by
Locke, combined with the rejection of the classical commitment to reason
and proper limits that caused the ecological crisis. One is left
wondering what endowed the authoritarian power with the wisdom to rule
which everyone else lacks. Indeed, none of the prescriptions for
Leviathan includes measures to insure its wisdom or political skill.
Surely, it takes more than brute force to make wise use of scarce
resources, balance population with resources, and decide on appropriate
levels and uses of technology. It will require skill to persuade modern
men that the industrial capacities of the society ought not be developed
without regard to the supply of natural resources, and to persuade them
to exercise restraint when no immediately ap- parent reasons exist.

Ophuls\' new position still traps him between competing political
traditions. He wishes to affirm the basic materialism of Enlightenment
thought, which attempts to explain the human situation in terms of
biological survival and man\'s relationship to physical nature. At the
same time he hopes for the revival of classical politics while yet
refusing to affirm the classical faith in an objective good that can
guide man in the selection of appropriate ends for his life.51 Like
Rousseau and many contemporary thinkers, Ophuls wants the best of the
classical and mod- ern worlds, irrespective of the wide epistemological
gulf separating clas- sical Greek thought from the Enlightenment.

## Illegitimate resource acquisition justifies redistribution

**Will Kymlicka, Professor of Philosophy, University of Toronto,
CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, 1990, p 109.**

Because **[most initial acquisition was in fact illegitimate, Nozick\'s
theory cannot protect existing holdings from
redistribution.]{.underline}** But we still need to know how acquisition
could have arisen legiamately. If we cannot answer that question, then
we should not only postpone the implementation of Nozick\'s principle of
transfer until historical titles are ascertained or rectified, we should
reject it entirely. **[If there is no way that people can appropriate
unowned resources for themselves without denying other people\'s claim
to equal consideration, then Nozick\'s right of transfer never
starts.]{.underline}**

## Libertarians concede that extinction outweighs

Murray **Rothbard, libertarian**, Dean of Austrian School, Head of Mises
Institute, FOR A NEW LIBERTY: THE LIBERTARIAN MANIFESTO, 19**73**, p.
<http://www.mises.org/rothbard/newlibertywhole.asp#p263>. accessed

Many libertarians are uncomfortable with foreign policy matters and
prefer to spend their energies either on fundamental questions of
libertarian theory or on such \"domestic\" concerns as the free market
or privatizing postal service or garbage disposal. Yet an attack on war
or a warlike foreign policy is of crucial importance to libertarians.
There are two important reasons. One has become a cliche, but is all too
true nevertheless: **[the overriding importance of preventing a nuclear
holocaust. To all the long-standing reasons, moral and economic, against
an interventionist foreign policy has now been added the imminent,
ever-present threat of world destruction. If the world should be
destroyed, all the other problems and all the other isms---socialism,
capitalism, liberalism, or libertarianism---would be of no importance
whatsoever]{.underline}**.

## Redistribution is not an inherent affront to human dignity. As long as you believe helping others is good, redistribution doesn't threaten dignity

Will Kymlicka, Professor of Philosophy, University of Toronto
CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, 1990, p. 122-3.

Finally, **[Nozick might argue that welfare redistribution denies
people\'s dignity]{.underline}**, and this dignity is crucial to
treating people as equals (e.g. Nozick 1974: 334). Indeed Nozick often
writes as if the idea that other people have claims on the fruits of my
talents is an assault on my dignity. But this is implausible. **[One
problem is that, Nozick often ties dignity to
self-determination]{.underline}**, so that it will be liberal regimes,
not libertarian ones, which best promote each person\'s dignity. **[In
any event, dignity is predicated on, or a byproduct of, other moral
beliefs. We only feel something to be an attack on our dignity if we are
already convinced that it is wrong. Redistribution will feel like an
assault on dignity only if we believe it is morally wrong. If we believe
instead that redistribution is a required part of treating people as
equals, then it will serve to promote, rather than attack, people\'s
sense of equal dignity]{.underline}**.

ANARCHO-CAPITALISM WOULD GIVE RISE TO REGIMES OF DOMINATION AND
OPPRESSION, THIS POSES THE SINGLE GREATEST THREAT TO HUMAN EXISTENCE

Noam **Chomsky**, philosopher, CHOMSKY ON ANARCHO-CAPITALISM,2004, p. P.
http://flag.blackened.net/liberty/chomsky-on-ac.txt.

Anarcho-capitalism, in my opinion, is a doctrinal system which, if ever
implemented, would lead to forms of tyranny and oppression that have few
counterparts in human history. There isn\'t the slightest possibility
that its (in my view, horrendous) ideas would be implemented, because
they would quickly destroy any society that made this colossal error.
The idea of \"free contract\" between the potentate and his starving
subject is a sick joke, perhaps worth some moments in an academic
seminar exploring the consequences of (in my view, absurd) ideas, but
nowhere else.

## Nozick\'s concept of dignity requires access to resources

Will Kymlicka, Professor of Philosophy, University of Toronto,
CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, 1990, p. 150.

But, we have seen, the notion of dignity and agency that Nozick relies
on, based on the idea of acting on one\'s conception of oneself,
requires rights over resources as well as one\'s person. Having
independent access to resources is important for our purposes, and hence
our purposive freedom, but that argues for liberal equality not
libertarianism.

## Since initial acquisition was unjust, there are no legitimate entitlements 

Jonathan Wolff, philosopher, ROBERT NOZICK, 1991, p. 141.

Second, initial appropriation remains undefended by Nozick, and this may
well be because it is indefensible on libertarian grounds Allowing
people virtually unlimited appropriation of the world will importantly
restrict what others can do, thus undermining their liberty and
self-ownership. Thus Nozick\'s concept of ownership itself generates
conflicts, and so The project of allowing no restrictions upon ownership
itself falls into incoherence.

## Taxation redistributes freedom rather than limiting it

Will Kymlicka, Professor of Philosophy, University of Toronto,
CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, 1990, p, 147.

As soon as we ask that question, Flew\'s equation of capitalism with
freedom is undermined. For it is the owners of the resource who are made
free to dispose of it, while non-owners are deprived of that freedom.
Suppose that a large estate you would have inherited (in the absence of
an inheritance tax) now becomes a public park, or a low-income housing
project (as a result of the tax). The inheritance tax does not eliminate
the freedom to use the property, rather it redistributes that freedom.
If you inherit the estate, then you are free to dispose of it as you see
fit, but if I use your backyard for my picnic or garden without your
permission, then I am breaking the law, and the government will
intervene and coercively deprive me of the freedom to continue. On the
other hand, my freedom to use and enjoy the property is increased when
the welfare state taxes your inheritance to provide me with affordable
housing, or a public park. So the free market legally restrains my
freedom, while the welfare state increases it.

## *Taxes don\'t violate rights*

John Christman, Professor of Philosophy at Virginia Polytechnic
Institute, PHILOSOPHY AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS, Spring 1986, p.165.

Also, as Kearl has pointed out, persons who gain entitlements through
embedded labor may enter into a market, the function of which serves to
reduce inefficiencies, reduce externalities, and lower negotiation costs
which all increase the net social product produced from those
entitlements without demanding extra labor from individual traders Thus,
taxation which redistributes that extra product would amount to a
limitation of the ownership rights of the traders over the commodities
in question but not constitute an encroachment on the rights anyone has
to her or his labor (since the product redistributed is from the
increased efficiencies of the market mechanism, not increased labor.

## Violations of liberty don't justify rejecting welfare.

Thomas **Nagel,** Professor of Philosophy, New York University, READING
NOZICK, Jeffrey Paul, ed., 19**81**, p. 193.

Naturally any opposition to the power of governments will meet with a
certain sympathy from observers of the contemporary scene, and Nozick
emphasizes the connection between his view and the fight against legal
regulation of sexual behavior, drug use, and individual life styles. It
is easy to develop an aversion to state power by looking at how actual
states wield it. Their activities often include murder, torture,
political imprisonment, censorship, conscription for aggressive war, and
overthrowing the governments of other countries-not to mention tapping
the phones, reading the mail, or regulating the sexual behavior of their
own citizens. The objection to these abuses, however, is not that state
power exists, but that it is used to do evil rather than good.
Opposition to these evils cannot be translated into an ot jection to
welfare, public education, or the graduated income tax.

## Welfare enhances self determination.

Will **Kymlicka,** Professor of Philosophy, University of Toronto,
CONTEMPORARY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY, 19**90**, p 122.

Libertarians claim that liberal welfare programmes, by limiting
property-rights, unduly limit people\'s self-determination. Hence the
removal of welfare redistribution programmes (Nozick), or their
limitation to an absolute minimum (Fried), would be an improvement in
terms of self-determination. But that is a weak objection.
Redistributive programmes do restrict the self-determination of the well
off to a limited degree. But they also give real control over their
lives to people who previously lacked it. Liberal redistribution does
not sacrifice self-determination for some other goal. Rather, it aims at
a fairer distribution of the means required for self-determination.
Libertarianism, by contrast, allows undeserved inequalities in that
distribution-its concern with self-determination does not extend to a
concern for ensuring the fair distribution of the conditions required
for self-determination. In fact, it harms those who most need help in
securing those conditions. If each person is to be treated as an end in
herself, as Nozick says repeatedly, then I see no reason for preferring
;a libertarian regime to a liberal redistributive one.

## Redistribution is justified on utilitarian grounds

Peter **Singer**, Professor of Philosophy, Monash University, READING
NOZICK, Jeffrey Paul, ed., 19**81**, p. 50.

Utilitarianism has no problem in justifying a substantial amount of
compulsory redistribution from the rich to the poor. We all recognize
that \$1,000 means far less to people earning \$100,00 than it does to
people trying to support a family on \$6,000. Therefore in normal
circumstances we increase the total happiness when we take from those
with a lot and give to those with little. Therefore that is what we
ought to do. For the utilitarian it is as simple as that. The result
will not absolute equality of wealth. There may be some who need
relatively little to be happier, and others whose expensive tastes
require more to achieve the same level of happiness. If resources are
adequate the utilitarian will give each enough to make him happy, and
that will mean giving some more than others.

## Utilitarianism justifies the welfare state

Peter **Singer,** Professor of Philosophy, Monash University, READING
NOZICK, Jeffrey Paul, ed., 19**81**, p. 50-1.

None of the arguments Nozick uses against Rawls is decisive when invoked
against a utilitarian position. Utilitarianism gives a clear and
plausible defense not merely of progressive taxation, welfare payments,
and other methods of redistribution, but also of the general right of
the state to perform useful functions beyond the protection of its
citizens from force and fraud. Utilitarianism also provides an argument
in defense of the claim behind Williams\'s argument for equality-that
society should, so far as its resources allow, provide for the most
important needs of its members.

## Extinction outweighs

Murray **Rothbard,** libertarian, Dean of Austrian School, Head of Mises
Institute, FOR A NEW LIBERTY: THE LIBERTARIAN MANIFESTO, 19**73**, p.
<http://www.mises.org/rothbard/newlibertywhole.asp#p263>. accessed
4/20/06.

Many libertarians are uncomfortable with foreign policy matters and
prefer to spend their energies either on fundamental questions of
libertarian theory or on such \"domestic\" concerns as the free market
or privatizing postal service or garbage disposal. Yet an attack on war
or a warlike foreign policy is of crucial importance to libertarians.
There are two important reasons. One has become a cliche, but is all too
true nevertheless: [the overriding importance of preventing a nuclear
holocaust. To all the long-standing reasons, moral and economic, against
an interventionist foreign policy has now been added the imminent,
ever-present threat of world destruction. If the world should be
destroyed, all the other problems and all the other isms---socialism,
capitalism, liberalism, or libertarianism---would be of no importance
whatsoever]{.underline}.

## Excess liberty creates a moral vacuum

Robert **Nisbet**, Professor of Sociology, Columbia, FREEDOM AND VIRTUE,
George Carey, ed., 19**84**, p. 20.

For the conservative, individual freedom lies in the interstices of
social and moral authority. Only because of the restraining and guiding
effects of such authority does it become possible for human beings to
sustain so liberal a political government as that which the Founding
Fathers designed in this country and which flourished in England from
the late seventeenth century on. Remove the social bonds, as the more
zealous and uncompromising of libertarian individualists have proposed
ever since William Godwin, and you emerge with, not a free but a chaotic
people, not creative but impotent individuals. Human nature, Balzac
correctly wrote, cannot endure a moral vacuum.

## Libertarianism would undermine the moral basis of the liberal state

Walter **Berns**, Professor of Government, Georgetown, FREEDOM AND
VIRTUE, George Carey, ed., 19**84**, p. 32-3.

I think what I have said above is sufficient to illustrate my point: we
were founded on liberal principles, but we used the public authority in
nonliberal ways. We did so partly out of habit, I suppose, and partly
because there were men\--Horace Mann, the central figure in American
public schooling, is a good example-who reflected on our situation and
who knew that a liberal state could not be perpetuated with simply
self-interested citizens. Men had to be taught to be public-spirited, to
care for others, to be at least somewhat altruistic. In the course of
time, and partly as the result of Supreme Court decisions affecting
public education, public support of private education, and, of course,
the censorship of obscenity, we have ceased to use the public authority
in these ways. We can now be said to be living off the fat we built up
in the past. I shudder to think of what would happen if we moved all the
way from liberalism to libertarianism.

## Blanket statements about coercion are false, must evaluate coercion on a case by case basis

**Stein 98** \[Herbert, senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute and was on the board of contributors of The Wall Street
Journal. He was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under
President Nixon and President Ford. In the 1970s, he was a professor of
economics at the University of Virginia, "What I think: Essays on
Economics, Politics, and Life". 1998 P. 7\]

Today\'s concern is mainly about coercion by the state. [We have many
government regulations today, mainly related to health and the
environment, that we did not have fifty years ago. We have fewer
regulations about international trade, agriculture, transportation, and
banking than we did the]{.underline}n. I don\'t know whether there is
more regulation now than there was. More important, it is essential to
have some feeling about the coerciveness of government coercion. [It is
one thing to be prevented from producing an automobile that emits more
than a specified amount of carbon dioxide by a regulation enacted
pursuant to a democratic legislative process, applied objectively and
subject to judicial review. It is quite a different thing to be thrown
into]{.underline} the Lubyanka [prison and shot for malting a critical
remark about the dictator]{.underline}. I agree that much of current
government regulation is unnecessary and inefficient. [I admire the
people who diligently analyze all regulation and point out the follies
that they find. They are engaged in the constant tidying up needed for a
good society, but they are not carrying on a revolution]{.underline}

## Turn: Autonomy bad

**Gaylin and Jennings, 1996, William, psychoanalytic medicine professor
at Columbia, president of Hastings Center and Bruce, director of Center
for Humans and Nature, The Perversion of Autonomy: the proper uses of
coercion and constraints in a liberal society. Pages 5-6. New York, NY,
The Free Press, 1996)**

The dark side of the culture of autonomy is becoming increasingly
apparent: something akin to decadence is setting in. Individualism,
privacy, and rights claims are sometimes **so overblown** that they
become caricatures of themselves. The individualistic philosophy that
has been the backbone of political liberalism and that protects the
person from the power of the state has become hyperextended into a kind
of social liberalism that sees power, and nothing but power, everywhere,
and that casts the same acids of suspicion ; mistrust on the family and
civil associations that political liberals have traditionally reserved
for the government. Extending the claims of autonomy as America has been
doing recently is dangerous for two reasons. First, it invites a
politically; socially reactionary backlash that could threaten civil
liberties across the board, and not just the exaggerated ones. Equally
dangerous, more subtle and insidious, is the possibility that it will
come to un¬dermine the very social and psychic infrastructure upon which
social order, and hence the conditions for autonomy itself, rests. The
social infrastructure to which we refer consists primarily of the family
and the various civic institutions through which individuals live as
par¬ents, friends, and neighbors; as church, synagogue, or mosque
mem¬bers; as volunteers, professionals, and citizens. The psychic
infrastruc¬ture endangered by the culture of autonomy is those processes
of childrearing, socialization, and moral development that create the
motivational basis for responsible conduct in the social emotions of
shame, guilt, pride, and conscience. Maintaining these foundations of
social order requires respect for authority as well as respect for
freedom; it requires institutional power and restraint as well as
self-expression and independence.

Individual human beings are not born or fashioned with fully formed
knowledge, values, goals, or personalities; they must each form their
own values and goals, develop their personalities, and learn about
themselves and the world around them. Every man must have freedom, must
have the scope to form, test, and act upon his own choices, for any sort
of development of his own personality to take place. He must, in short,
be free in order that he may be fully human. In a sense, even the most
frozen and totalitarian civilizations and societies have allowed at
least a modicum of scope for individual choice and development. Even the
most monolithic of despotisms have had to allow at least a bit of
\"space\" for freedom of choice, if only within the interstices of
societal rules. The freer the society, of course, the less has been the
interference with individual actions, and the greater the scope for the
development of each individual. The freer the society, then, the greater
will be the variety and the diversity among men, for the more fully
developed will be every man\'s uniquely individual personality. On the
other hand, the more despotic the society, the more restrictions on the
freedom of the individual, the more uniformity there will be among men
and the less the diversity, and the less developed will be the unique
personality of each and every man. In a profound sense, then, a despotic
society prevents its members from being fully human.

Each increase in coercion is easier to justify. If it's right to force
banks to report your finances to the government, then it's right to
force you to justify the cash in your pocket at the airport. If it's
right to take property from the rich and give it to the poor, then it's
right to take your property for the salt marsh harvest mouse. As each
government program fails, it becomes "necessary" to move another step
closer to complete control over our lives. As one thing leads to another
-- as coercion leads to more coercion -- what can we look forward to? --
Will it become necessary to force you to justify everything you do to
any government agent who thinks you might be a threat to society? --
Will it become necessary to force your children to report your personal
habits to their teachers or the police? -- Will it become necessary to
force your neighbors to monitor your activities? -- Will it become
necessary to force you to attend a reeducation program to learn how to
be more sensitive, or how not to discriminate, or how to avoid being
lured into taking drugs, or how to recognize suspicious behavior? --
Will it become necessary to prohibit some of your favorite foods and ban
other pleasures, so you don't fall ill or have an accident -- putting a
burden on America's health-care system? Some of these things -- such as
getting children to snitch on their parents or ordering people into
reeducation programs -- are already happening in America. The others
have been proposed and are being considered seriously. History has shown
that each was an important step in the evolution of the world's worst
tyrannies. We move step by step further along the road to oppression
because each step seems like such a small one. And because we're told
that each step will give us something alluring in return -- less crime,
cheaper health care, safety from terrorists, an end to discrimination --
even if none of the previous steps delivered on its promise. And because
the people who promote these steps are well-meaning reformers who would
use force only to build a better world.

## Coercion isn't justified to prevent coercion -- this mindset leads to war

Murray **Rothbard**, Academic Vice President of the Ludwig Mises
Institute and the Center for Libertarian Studies, THE ETHICS OF LIBERTY,
19**82**, p. http://www.mises.org/rothbard/ethics/fifteen.asp DOA
5/20/06.

EACH STATE HAS AN assumed monopoly of force over a given territorial
area, the areas varying in size in accordance with different historical
conditions. *Foreign policy, or foreign relations*, may be defined as
the relationship between any particular State, A, and other States, B,
C, D, and the inhabitants living under those States. In the ideal moral
world, no States would exist, and hence, of course, no foreign policy
could exist. Given the existence of States, however, are [there, any
moral principles that libertarianism can direct as criteria for foreign
policy? The answer is broadly the same as in the libertarian moral
criteria directed toward the "domestic policy" of States, namely to
reduce the degree of coercion exercised by States over individual
persons as much as possible.]{.underline} Before considering inter-State
actions, let us return for a moment to the pure libertarian stateless
world where individuals and their hired private protection agencies
strictly confine their use of violence to the defense of person and
property against violence. [Suppose that,]{.underline} in this world,
[Jones finds that he or his property is being aggressed against by
Smith]{.underline}. It is legitimate, as we have seen, for Jones to
repel this invasion by the use of defensive violence. But, now we must
ask: [is it within the right of Jones to commit aggressive violence
against innocent third parties in the course of his legitimate defense
against Smith]{.underline}? Clearly [the answer must be
"No]{.underline}." For [the rule prohibiting violence against the
persons or property of innocent men is absolute; it holds regardless of
the subjective motives for the aggression. It is wrong, and criminal, to
violate the property or person of another, even if one is a Robin Hood,
or is starving, or is defending oneself against a third]{.underline}
man['s attack]{.underline}. We may understand and sympathize with the
motives in many of these cases and extreme situations. We (or, rather,
the victim or his heirs) may later mitigate the guilt if the criminal
comes to trial for punishment, but [we cannot evade the judgment that
this aggression is still a criminal act]{.underline}, and one which the
victim has every right to repel, by violence if necessary. In short, A
aggresses against B because C is threatening, or aggressing against, A.
We may understand C's "higher" culpability in this whole procedure, but
we still label this aggression by A as a criminal act which B has every
right to repel by violence. To be more concrete, [if Jones finds that
his property is being stolen by Smith, Jones has the right to repel him
and try to catch him, but Jones has no right to repel him by bombing a
building and murdering innocent people or to catch him by spraying
machine gun fire into an innocent crowd. If he does this, he is as much
(or more) a criminal aggressor as Smith is]{.underline}. The same
criteria hold if Smith and Jones each have men on his side, i.e., if
"war" breaks out between Smith and his henchmen and Jones and his
bodyguards. If Smith and a group of henchmen aggress against Jones, and
Jones and his bodyguards pursue the Smith gang to their lair, we may
cheer Jones on in his endeavor; and we, and others in society interested
in repelling aggression, may contribute financially or personally to
Jones's cause. But Jones and his men have no right, any more than does
Smith, to aggress against anyone else in the course of their "just war":
to steal others' property in order to finance their pursuit, to
conscript others into their posse by use of violence, or to kill others
in the course of their struggle to capture the Smith forces. If Jones
and his men should do any of these things, they become criminals as
*fully* as Smith, and they too become subject to whatever sanctions are
meted out against criminality. In fact if Smith's crime was theft, and
Jones should use conscription to catch him, or should kill innocent
people in the pursuit, then Jones becomes more of a criminal than Smith,
for such crimes against another person as enslavement and murder are
surely far worse than theft. Suppose that Jones, in the course of his
\"just war\" against the ravages of Smith, should kill some innocent
people; and suppose that he should declaim, in defense of this murder,
that he was simply acting on the slogan, "give me liberty or give me
death." The absurdity of this "defense" should be evident at once, for
[the issue is not whether Jones was willing to risk death personally in
his defensive struggle against Smith; the issue is whether he was
willing to kill other innocent people in pursuit of his legitimate end.
For Jones was in truth acting on the completely indefensible slogan:
"Give me liberty or give *them* death"---surely a far less noble battle
cry]{.underline}. War, then, even a just defensive war, is only proper
when the exercise of violence is rigorously limited to the individual
criminals themselves. [We may judge for ourselves how many wars or
conflicts in history have met this criterion. It has often been
maintained, and especially by conservatives, that the development of the
horrendous modern weapons of mass murder (nuclear weapons, rockets, germ
warfare, etc.) is only a difference of *degree* rather than *kind* from
the simpler weapons of an earlier era]{.underline}. Of course, one
answer to this is that when the degree is the number of human lives,
[the difference is a very big one]{.underline}. But a particularly
libertarian reply is that while the bow and arrow, and even the rifle,
can be pinpointed, if the will be there, against actual criminals,
modern nuclear weapons cannot. Here is a crucial difference in kind. Of
course, the bow and arrow could be used for aggressive purposes, but it
could also be pinpointed to use only against aggressors. Nuclear
weapons, even "conventional" aerial bombs, cannot be. These weapons are
*ipso facto* engines of indiscriminate mass destruction. (The only
exception would be the extremely rare case where a mass of people who
were *all* criminals inhabited a vast geographical area.) We must,
therefore, conclude that the use of nuclear or similar weapons, or the
threat thereof, is a crime against humanity for which there can be no
justification. This is why the old cliche no longer holds that it is not
the arms but the will to use them that is significant in judging matters
of war and peace. For it is precisely the characteristic of modern
weapons that they cannot be used selectively, *cannot* be used in a
libertarian manner. Therefore, their very existence must be condemned,
and nuclear disarmament becomes a good to be pursued for its own sake.
Indeed, of all the aspects of liberty, such disarmament becomes the
highest political good that can be pursued in the modern world. For
[just as murder is a more heinous crime]{.underline} against another man
[than larceny so mass murder---indeed murder so widespread as to
threaten human civilization and human survival itself---is the worst
crime]{.underline} that any man could possibly commit. [And that crime
is now all too possible]{.underline}.

## Human dignity outweighs -- Utilitarianism fails to protect rights

Loren **Lomasky**, philosophy professor, University of Minnesota,
PERSONS, RIGHTS, AND THE MORAL COMMUNITY, 19**87**, p. 18.

It might prove to be the case that by violating the rights of one
person, five equally grave rights violations will be averted. If so,
then a "utilitarianism of rights" will endorse the one rights-violation
act while a side constraint account will reject it. But how can this
rejection be presented as anything other than a single-minded fanaticism
that devours its indebted beneficiary in the case of preserving it? "You
maintain that the protection of rights is of great, even transcendent
value. Very well then more upholding of rights is better then less. If
one violation is necessary to prevent many others your own principles
ought to lead you to prefer the former. Yet you obstinately resist." How
is this criticism to be countered? The problem that has been identified
is that rights may prove to be inconvient. They set up barriers which
neither private individuals nor governmental bodies may breach at their
pleasure. To be sure, that may often be advantageous in a morally
unproblematic way. Human beings are notoriously susceptible to
temptations to pursue their narrow self-interest at the expense of the
well-being others. Were sympathy and beneficences the strongest and most
universally shared emotions, it might be feasible to do without barriers
of any kind --moral rules, rights, legally enforceable obligations---and
rely instead on the promptings of individuals' hearts to secure a
decently livable life for all. Unfortunately, [the animal we are
is]{.underline} much more [recognizable in the Hobbesian
caricatures]{.underline} than in this idyllic alternative. So
[incursions must be prevented if we are to attain a tolerably decent
measure of sociability. By recognizing each individual as a bearer of
rights all are afforded some protection against the predations that
would otherwise ensue. Even when arguments for overriding rights are
couched in the most high-minded terms, faced with referenced to the
general welfare or the need for mental sacrifice in a just cause one may
suspect that the rhetoric is meant to yield the most for power or
personal attainment]{.underline} History is a textbook for cynics.
Having read from it, we may be prompted to insist on undeviating respect
for rights, no matter how beckoning are inducements to the contrary,
because we have no confidence in people's ability to discriminate
accurately and dispassionately between incursions that will maximize
public good and those that will debase it. [If we are to err either on
the side of too much flexibility or excess dignity, better---far better
the later.]{.underline}

## Non-absolute rights fails to protect freedom.

Tibor **Machan**, Philosophy Professor, Auburn,INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR
RIGHTS, 19**89**, pp. 119-21.

By not treating basic human rights as basic, [all]{.underline} Gewirth
and [others do is invite some other set of principles we will have to
turn to when we need to make principled decisions]{.underline} about
what people are free or not free to do. Or, more likely, they leave the
matter to the discretion of those who sit as judges in the courts.
Indeed, the current legal climate, in which any strong political
interest group can secure the protection of some alleged right to
well-being --- to be provided with medical care, child-care facilities,
a museum, the preservation of an historical building, a subsidy, or the
imposition of a tariff upon a foreign import business --- suggests what
can be expected of a welfare state, a system that embraces both the
limited right to liberty and the limited right to welfare.
[The]{.underline} r[esulting situation is a kind of Hobbesian war of
special interests against all other special interests, each demanding
the protection of its alleged liberty]{.underline} or welfare rights.
Gewirth, like Gregory Viastos before him, seems to forget that rights
are basic principles of political life and that making them inherently
unstable deprives them of their essential character. [To make rights
nonabsolute within the legal context is to open a Pandora's box of
bureaucratic arbitrariness]{.underline} producing the very situation
that the moral-political principles we know as human rights were
explicitly designed to render impermissible. Instead of [treating human
rights]{.underline} as contextually deontological, as principles rather
than [piecemeal rules of thumb]{.underline}, Gewirth and Dworkin [are
inviting the elitism that utilitarianism requires]{.underline} --- that
is, [certain leaders whose value-judgments must be imposed on the
rest]{.underline} whenever they find it intuitively certain or in some
other fashion warranted to override basic human, individual rights.
There is a snowballing effect arising from this kind of utilitarian
thinking. [Such thinking ought to be avoided and alternatives to solving
the problems for which the violations of rights seemed to be justified
should be sought]{.underline}.

We are not unfamiliar with the hazards of the slippery slope in our own
personal lives. If a man hits his child in some alleged emergency, the
very act of doing so may render him more amenable to smacking the kid
under more typical circumstances. Slapping someone who is hysterical may
make it easier to slap someone who is only very upset or recalcitrant or
annoying or just too slow fetching the beer from the refrigerator.
Similarly, a "minor" breach of trust can beget more of the same, a
little white lie here and there can beget lying as a routine, and so
forth. Moral habits promote a principled course of action even in cases
where bending or breaking the principle might not seem too harmful to
other parties or to our own integrity. On the other hand, granting
ourselves "reasonable" exceptions tends to weaken our moral habits; as
we seek to rationalize past action, differences of kind tend to devolve
into differences of degree. Each new exception provides the precedent
for the next, until we lose our principles altogether and doing what is
right becomes a matter of happenstance and mood rather than of loyalty
to enduring values. The same is true of public action. When citizens of
a country delegate to government, by means of democratic and judicial
processes, the power to forge paternalistic public policies such as
banning drug abuse, imposing censorship, restraining undesirable trade,
and supporting desirable trade, the bureaucratic and police actions
increasingly rely on the kind of violence and intrusiveness that no free
citizenry ought to experience or foster. And the bureaucrats and the
police tell themselves, no doubt, that what they're doing is perfectly
just and right. Consider, for starters, that when no one complains about
a crime---because it is not perpetrated against someone but rather
involves breaking a paternalistic law---to even detect the "crime"
requires methods that are usually invasive. Instead of charges being
brought by wronged parties, phone tapping, snooping, anonymous
reporting, and undercover work are among the dubious means that lead to
prosecution. Thus the role of the police shifts from protection and
peacekeeping to supervision, regimentation, and reprimand. No wonder,
then, that officers of the law are often caught brutalizing suspects
instead of merely apprehending them. Under a paternalistic regime, their
goals have multiplied, and thus the means they see as necessary to
achieving those goals multiply too. The same general danger of
corrupting a free society's system of laws may arise when government is
called on to deal with calamities. There is the perception, of course,

Liberty Magazine, financial advisor and economist, 19**95**, Why
Government Doesn't Work, p. 66-7

**Their better world never materializes because it depends upon coercion
to succeed**. And **coercion never improves society**. So government is
always promising to do something that's impossible --- such as coercing
people to stop taking drugs or abandon their prejudices. When the
coercion doesn't work, the politicians must impose harsher and harsher
measures in order to show they're "serious" about the problem and,
inevitably, we come to the abuses we saw in the preceding chapter ---
such as property seizures and "no-knock" invasions of your home. These
*aren't legal mistakes in need of reform. They* are the inevitable
result of asking government to use coercion to create a better world*.*
Each increase in coercion is easier to justify. If it's right to force
banks to report your finances to the government, then it's right to
force you to justify the cash in your pocket at the airport. If it's
right to take property from the rich to give to the poor, then it's
right to take your property for the salt marsh harvest mouse. As each
government program fails, it becomes "necessary" to move another step
closer to complete control over our lives. As one thing leads to another
--- as coercion leads to more coercion --- what can Will it become
necessary to force you to justifywe look forward to? everything you do
to any government agent who thinks you might be a threat to Will it
become necessary to force your children to report yoursociety? Will it

taking drugs, or how Will it become necessary to prohibit someto
recognize suspicious behavior? of your favorite foods and ban other
pleasures, so you don't fall ill or have an accident putting a burden on
America's health-care system? Some of these things --- such as getting
children to snitch on their parents or ordering people into reeducation
programs --- already are happening in America. The others have been
proposed and are being considered seriously. History has shown that each
was an important step in the evolution of the world's worst tyrannies.

## Uncompromising stance on libertarian principles is key.

Edward **Romar**, Lecturer in Management -- U. Mass. Boston College of
Management, Journal of Business Ethics, "Noble Markets: The Noble/Slave
Ethic in Hayek's Free Market Capitalism", 85:57-66, 20**09**, Springer

Like Nietzsche, Hayek, though acutely aware of the importance of ethics
in a world based upon maximum freedom, did not develop a complete
ethical theory to support the functioning of free market capitalism.
[Like Nietzsche, Hayek does not claim to know the meaning of
morality]{.underline} or, in Nietzsche's case, good and evil.3 [Beyond
support for the principles needed to anchor the functioning of free
markets and the institutions needed to support them, Hayek left it to
individual actors to develop their own moral principles]{.underline}, so
long as these did not contradict those needed to support free markets.
[It was not his intention to prescribe a detailed ethical system to
support free market capitalism because to do so would violate his
principle of freedom and curtail the creativity of markets. Yet, the
world described by Hayek is one where individuals have substantial power
to control their destiny and seek their own level, a world where talent
and risk dominate]{.underline}, a world governed by self interest, a
world where individuals have few responsibilities to others, and a world
driven by competition where reward goes to the successful. He described
a world open to Nietzschean ethics. In The Road to Serfdom (1994) and
The Fatal Conceit (1988) [Hayek presents a powerful and eloquent attack
on twentieth century totalitarianism**.** In The Road to Serfdom he
argues that the socialist experiment must inevitably lead to
totalitarianism and the complete elimination of individual liberty and
freedom. In the name of principles of social justice, society installs a
system of centralized social and economic planning, substitutes
collective decisions for individual ones, and requires each person to
adopt an identical and complete set of social values]{.underline}**.**
Furthermore**,** [to achieve its objectives, the socialist state must
determine in great detail the allocation of resources and insure that
each individual performs precisely his/her assigned role. Planned
economies must substitute collectivist thought, values and behavior and
eliminate any room for individualism. Hayek labels this weltanschauung
the ''fatal conceit.'' It is fatal because it cannot achieve its
objectives and it is conceit because it overestimates the role of human
rationality and man's ability to control social and economic
processes]{.underline}. He sees constructivist continental European
philosophic thought, primarily [Cartesian rationalism]{.underline}, as
the source of this error (Hayek, 1948, pp. 9--10; 1973, pp. 9--12). This
philosophic tradition [argues that man can understand the world
completely and,]{.underline} therefore, [social and economic processes
can be understood completely and molded to fit human will. Hayek
considers this a foolish, self-serving and arrogant
position**.**]{.underline}4 Certainly, humans have a powerful intellect
and reasoning skills. Human reason, though powerful, has its limitations
and cannot completely understand with any certainty how human
institutions and social processes evolved and how they operate. He views
the evolution and development of human institutions, be they money,
markets, or ethics as spontaneous, self-generating orders. Systems, if
you will, evolving gradually, accidentally, on the basis of incremental
change; not as a result of human design. He labels this ''between
instinct and reason.'' Humans can understand to some extent how human
society evolved from clan based societies into modern, complex ones
based upon individualism and abstract rules, but we cannot know the
processes or mechanisms of this evolution in sufficient detail to bend
them to our will. [We can tweak the social and moral systems but cannot
engineer them. Man can modify social processes and their underlying
ethical foundations; but, in the final analysis, we must accept them as
is.5 Since social process and institutions obey their own set of
evolutionary principles which man cannot know completely, it is best for
these to evolve on their own, without much human
interference.]{.underline} In The Constitution of Liberty (1960) and
Law, Legislation and Liberty (3 vols., 1973, 1976, 1979) Hayek develops
his ideas about the proper principles of economic and political
organizations and their underlying ethical foundations. [The fundamental
principle of social organization must be based upon the principle of
liberty, which may be defined as ''that condition of men in which
coercion of some by others is reduced as much as possible in
society''6]{.underline} (Hayek, 1960, p. 11). Hayek's conception of the
free, just and moral society is not one where there is a complete
absence of coercion but where coercion is limited to those situations
where it is required to prevent a reduction in the liberty of others.
Society may use coercion to protect private property and to secure
individual rights and conditions which allow each person the maximum
amount of personal freedom to make choices of their own. This is
accomplished through a limited set of abstract rules ''that apply
equally to all'' which protect private or several property, enforce
contracts, and prevent fraud and deception'' (Hayek, 1960, pp. 140, 141,
143, 155). While Hayek is concerned with just and moral principles of
economic, political and social organization, [he views attempts to
achieve ''distributive justice'' as the root cause of the immorality
brought about by planned economies. In order to achieve the desired
goals, human behavior must be planned in minute detail, thereby
eliminating freedom of choice. Achieving collectivist goals mean that
there can be no individual ones. Organizing to control every outcome
means there cannot be individual]{.underline} choice. Social control
means there will be little individual control and it is all doomed
because humans cannot understand completely the mechanisms needed to
reach their objectives. [The only solution must be the free market and
the minimal organizational principles required for it to operate
efficiently. Since these are few and well known, it will be easier to
succeed and create a just and moral society. Allow the market free reign
and the just and moral society will follow according to its own
principles]{.underline}**.**

## Allowing any realm of government control quickly snowballs to totalitarian collectivism.

Jack **Douglas**, Prof. Emeritus Soc. -- UC San Diego, "The Myth of the
Welfare State", 19**91**, p. 40, Google Print

[The logic of totalitarian collectivism is simple]{.underline}**,**
brutal, and entirely consistent. [Once a people has
decided]{.underline}\--whether actively or, more commonly, by default,
by not actively stopping them\--[to allow politicians to
decide]{.underline} by legislation, and without severe constraints of
custom, moral principle and constitutional law, [what is right and wrong
in such basic realms of life as economic property rights, then there is
no longer any logical constraint upon their exercise of power in all
other realms of life]{.underline}. As classical liberals saw, even in
the vastly more simple and self-contained society of the eighteenth
century, [without inviolate property rights no other rights can long be
sustained. The government that controls our property rights must
ultimately control our right to the pursuit of
happiness]{.underline}**,** our right to [free speech]{.underline} and
to the publication of that speech, our right to take a spouse or have
children, our right to work and choose an occupation, [our right to life
itself\--for all things of life are ultimately dependent upon material
goods]{.underline} and, thus, upon the controls of those goods we call
property rights. [The government that has the right to legislate gas
prices in Texas, or income redistribution nationwide, has every logical
right to dictate]{.underline} research standards in physics, hiring
standards in sociology, [wage rates]{.underline} for black teenagers in
New York, parental care standards for all parents, [the right to bear
children, the right to redefine life, and\--the right to
everything**.**]{.underline} When the American people, tempted by the
ancient enabling myth of the welfare state, used the power of their
votes to give the politicians and, by inaction, the courts the power to
legislate away and rule away our ancient economic rights\--our freedoms
from unconstrained government control of our property for the common
welfare\--they unknowingly gave them power to legislate away and rule
away all our ancient rights. Almost a hundred years ago, Theodore
Roosevelt, one of the first heroes of the rationalistic state planning
of American progressivism proclaimed, \"Every man holds his property
subject to the general right of the community to regulate its use to
whatever degree the public welfare may require it.\" The insidious
implications of that \"to whatever degree\" for the counterrevolution
against the System of Natural Liberty became clear only slowly, [but for
almost a century now the American state has been pursuing that
relentless logic of totalitarian collectivism at an accelerating
rate.]{.underline}

Robert. "Rawl's Defense of the Priority of Liberty: A Kantian
Reconstruction." Princeton University Press. Philosophy & Public Affairs
31, No. 3, Pg 5. Project MUSE.

Up to this point, Rawls has said nothing about the priority of the basic
liberties; rather, he has focused exclusively on their equal provision.
Only at the end of his main presentation of the Self-Respect Argument
does he briefly discuss the Priority of Liberty: When it is the position
of equal citizenship that answers to the need for status, the precedence
of the equal liberties becomes all the more necessary. [Having chosen a
conception of justice that seeks to eliminate the significance of
relative economic and social advantages as supports for men's
self-confidence, it is essential that the priority of liberty be firmly
maintained (p. 478).These two sentences provide a good illustration of
what I earlier called the Inference Fallacy:]{.underline}
[Rawls]{.underline} tries to derive the lexical priority of the basic
liberties from the central importance of an interest they support---in
this case, an interest in securing self-respect for all citizens.
Without question, the Self-Respect Argument [makes a strong case for
assigning the basic liberties a *high* priority: otherwise, economic and
social inequalities might reemerge as the primary determinants of status
and therefore of self-respect. It does not explain, however, why
*lexical* priority is needed. Why, for example, would very small
restrictions on the basic liberties threaten the social basis of
self-respect, so long as they were equally applied to all citizens? Such
restrictions would involve no subordination and, being very small, would
be unlikely to jeopardize the central importance of equal citizenship as
a determinant of status.]{.underline}

Robert. "Rawl's Defense of the Priority of Liberty: A Kantian
Reconstruction." Princeton University Press. Philosophy & Public Affairs
31, No. 3, Pgs 20-21. Project MUSE.

Although Rawls briefly discusses and defends the Priority of Liberty
early in *Political Liberalism* (PL, pp. 41, 74, 76), his most sustained
arguments for it are to be found late in the book, in the lecture
entitled "The Basic Liberties and Their Priority." *All* of these
arguments are framed in terms of Justice as Fairness rather than liberal
political conceptions of justice more generally, a point to which we
will return below. The three arguments for the Priority of Liberty that
we identified in *Theory* can also be found in *Political Liberalism*,
and both their strengths and weaknesses carry over into the new
context.18 At least two new arguments can be found, however, arguments
that I will refer to as the Stability Argument and the Well-Ordered
Society Argument, respectively. As I will now show, both of these
arguments are further illustrations of the Inference Fallacy. The
Stability Argument has a structure similar to that of the Self- Respect
Argument. In it, [Rawls notes the "great advantage to everyone's
conception of the good of a . . . stable scheme of cooperation," and he
goes on to assert that Justice as Fairness is "the most stable
conception of justice . . . and this is the case importantly because of
the basic liberties and the priority assigned to
them."]{.underline}Taking the second point first, [Rawls never makes
clear why the Priority of Liberty is *necessary* for stability, as
opposed to strongly contributory to it. **Very small restrictions on the
basic liberties would seem unlikely to threaten it,** and some types of
restrictions]{.underline} (e.g., imposing fines for the advocacy of
violent revolution or race hatred) [might actually *enhance*
it.]{.underline} Even if we assume, however, that the Priority of
Liberty is necessary for stability, this fact is not enough to justify
it: [as highly valued as stability is, sacrificing the basic liberties
that make it possible may be worthwhile if such a sacrifice is necessary
to advance *other* highly valued ends. Pointing out the *high* priority
of stability, in other words, is insufficient to justify the lexical
priority of the basic liberties that support it---only the *lexical*
priority of stability would do so, yet Rawls provides no argument for
why stability should be so highly valued.]{.underline}

## Rawls' conception of personal freedom cannot resolve utilitarian democratic ideals. {#rawls-conception-of-personal-freedom-cannot-resolve-utilitarian-democratic-ideals. .Tags}

**Taylor, professor of philosophy @ Princeton. 2003.**

Robert. "Rawl's Defense of the Priority of Liberty: A Kantian
Reconstruction." Princeton University Press. Philosophy & Public Affairs
31, No. 3, Pgs 22-23. Project MUSE.

Rawls speculates that "the narrower the differences between the liberal
conceptions when correctly based on fundamental ideas in a democratic
public culture . . . the narrower the range of liberal conceptions
defining the focus of the consensus."25 By "correctly based," Rawls
appears to mean at least two things: first, that the conceptions should
be built on the "more central" of these fundamental ideas; second, that
these ideas should be interpreted in the right way (PL, pp. 167--68).
For example, [Rawls asserts that his "conception of the person as free
and equal" is "central to the democratic ideal" (PL, p. 167). This idea
is in competition with other democratic ideas, however]{.underline}
[(e.g., the idea of the "common good" as it is understood by classical
republicans), as well as with other interpretations of the same idea
(e.g., the utilitarian understanding of "equality" as the equal
consideration of each person's welfare). A necessary condition, then,
for Justice as Fairness to be the focus of an overlapping consensus
would be for adherents of all reasonable comprehensive doctrines to
endorse this ide]{.underline}a, along with the interpretation Rawls
gives it, as [more "central to the democratic ideal" than other
fundamental ideas]{.underline}. If they were to accept not only this
idea but also its companion idea of society as "a fair system of
cooperation," then the procedures of political constructivism (including
the Original Position) would presumably lead them to select Justice as
Fairness as their political conception of justice.

Carl **Knight** -- P.h.d International Studies 20**08**, 34, 713--733,
British International Studies Association "A pluralistic approach to
global poverty"

But [Rawls' masterpiece]{.underline} also [presents]{.underline} some
[obvious obstacles to global poverty alleviation.]{.underline} [A Theory
of Justice explicitly states that the theory is only to be applied
within a society]{.underline}. Furthermore, in those few places where
the book oﬀers some tangential discussion of transdomestic justice, it
is characterised as a question of 'the justice of the law of nations and
of relations between states'.16 Hence, in a discussion occasioned by his
analysis of conscription and conscientious refusal, Rawls suggests that
'one may extend the interpretation of the original position and think of
the parties as representatives of diﬀerent nations who must choose
together the fundamental principles to adjudicate conﬂicting claims
among states'.17 He com- ments that this procedure is 'fair among
nations', and that there would be 'no surprises' in the outcome, 'since
the principles chosen would . . . be familiar ones' ensuring treaty
compliance, describing the conditions for just wars, and granting rights
of self-defence and self-determination -- [the latter being 'a right of
a people to settle its own aﬀairs without the intervention of foreign
powers']{.underline}.18 This is, then, [a thoroughly nationalist
conception of justice: social justice applies only within a state or
nation.]{.underline} Rawls's radical principles of distributive justice,
such as the diﬀerence principle, would only hold transdomestically
where, improbably, states had signed treaties to this eﬀec[t. Given that
such wide ranging internationally redistributive treaties have never
been signed, A Theory of Justice provided a rationale for the Western
general public's impression that their duties to the global poor are, at
most, those of charity.]{.underline} Rawls' full expression of his views
in this area came nearly three decades later in The Law of Peoples.19
Here [Rawls]{.underline} again uses the notion of a transdomestic
original position, [argu]{.underline}ing [that]{.underline} it is [an
appropriate instrument for selecting laws to govern]{.underline}
[relations]{.underline} between both liberal societies and 'decent
non-liberal societies', especially those which are 'decent hierarchical
societies', being non-aggressive, recognising their citizens' human
rights, assigning widely acknowledged additional rights and duties, and
being backed by genuine and not unreasonable beliefs among judges and
other oﬃcials that the law embodies a 'common good idea of justice'.20
This Society of Peoples would agree to be guided by eight principles
constituting 'the basic charter of the Law of Peoples'.21

Yet nobody in the welfare debate, as far as I know, invoked the Charles
Murray of *The Bell Curve* rather than the Murray of *Losing* *Ground.*
Moreover, while many right-wing arguments are neutral about questions of
class distinctions, others actually seem to be grounded in a kind of
relational egalitarianism. For example, conservatives sometimes argue
that welfare stigmatizes recipients. As we have already heard Gingrich
(1995, 71) say, \"[The welfare state reduces the poor from citizens to
clients.\" This argument raises a serious issue for relational
egalitarians: **How can the poor be given material aid with- out others
thinking less of them?** The stigma of being on the receiving end of
welfare may create the very divisions in society that the relational
egalitarian seeks to avoid]{.underline}. [If government programs
designed to help the poor stand in the way of citizens relating to each
other non-hierarchically]{.underline}, maybe [we should abolish such
programs in the interest of a society in which citizens stand as

[egalitarianism is incompatible with common good, in empowering some
people over others: roughly, the unproductive over the
productive.]{.underline} The former's interests are held to merit the
imposition of force over others, whereas the interests of the productive
do not. Yet producers, as such, merely produce; they don't use force
against others. Thus [egalitarianism denies the central rule of rational
human association. What could be thought to justify this apparent bias
in favour of the unproductive]{.underline}, the needy, the sick, against
the productive -- the healthy, the ingenious, the energetic? What are
the latter supposed to have done to the former to have merited the
egalitarian's impositions? [The answer can't be, 'Oh, nothing -- they're
just unlucky!]{.underline}' [or 'We don't like people like that!' A

In Rawls's (1993: 157) [universe, consensus is cemented into the
political founding and overrides all other issues.]{.underline} 26
[Anything that triggers political conflict is excluded from the public
sphere:]{.underline} "[A liberal view removes from the political agenda
the most divisive issues,]{.underline} serious contention about which
must undermine the bases of social cooperation." Difficult issues may be
interesting but, for Rawls, [they are not the stuff of
politics.]{.underline} [They threaten consensus and must be excluded or
contained in the private sphere. Politics is about tinkering, not
controversy.]{.underline} The only truly political moment in Rawls's
work, then, is laying the ground for justice as fairness in the original
posi- tion. [Once the principles of justice as fairness are
established]{.underline}, however, [the political sphere is essentially
closed.]{.underline} Efforts to re-open the foundation are a threat to
political stability. [The range of acceptable]{.underline} political
[issues is framed by principles that are not up for debate.]{.underline}
Hence, citizens are prevented from pursuing those modes of civic
involvement that would open the political sphere to real contestation.
Given the imperative of consensus, the regime must protect its political
founding from interrogation. [Narrowing the range of acceptable
political issues exacts a high cost from citizens.]{.underline} [Space
for dissent is eliminated.]{.underline} [The range of political
possibilities is restricted to one]{.underline} (and only one) that will
be fixed "once and for all" (Rawls 1993: 161). [Once the principles of
justice are instituted, only the support of the status quo is
possible]{.underline} (Alejandro 1998: 144). For Rawls, all citizens
affirm the same public conception of justice (1993: 39). [Public
discussion about alternative political possibilities is not
necessary.31]{.underline} Since a critical disposi- tion toward the
founding moment of justice as fairness would risk destroying consensus,
it is better to treat it as a monument before which one genuflects.
Rawls, however, does not purge all conflict from his model of
politic[s]{.underline} in the name of consensus. Some level of
reasonable disagreement is permitted in his liberal utopia. It arises
from the "burdens of judgment." The causes of these burdens are
formidable:

Stuart **White 2k**, "ReviewArticle: Social Rights and the Social
Contract -- Political Theory and the New Welfare Politics" Cambridge
University Press, B.J.Pol.S. 30, 507--53

*How Much Equality of Opportunity Does Fair Reciprocity Require?* I have
presented only a very intuitive account of the conditions of fair
reciprocity; I have not formally presented a full conception of
distributive justice and demonstrated how each condition follows from
this conception, something one might attempt in a lengthier analysis.
However, I do wish to examine one general philosophical issue that
arises when we come to think about the conditions of fair reciprocity.
[Assume that distributive justice is centrally about some form of equal
opportunity]{.underline}. The notion of equality of opportunity can, of
course, be understood in a number of different ways. But assume, for the
moment, that [we understand it in the radical form defended in
contemporary egalitarian theories of distributive
justice]{.underline}.40 [Equal opportunity in this sense
requires]{.underline}, *inter alia*, that [we seek to]{.underline}
prevent [or correct for inequalities]{.underline} in income attributable
to differences in natural ability and for inequalities in capability due
to handicaps that people suffer through no fault of their own. The
question I wish to consider can then be put like this: [How far must
society satisfy the demands of equal opportunity before we can plausibly
say]{.underline} that [all of its members have obligations]{.underline}
under the reciprocity principle? One view, which I shall call [the full
compliance view, is that the demands of equal opportunity must be
satisﬁed]{.underline} in full for it to be true that all citizens have
obligations to make productive contributions to the community under the
reciprocity principle. The intuition is that people can have no
obligation to contribute in a signiﬁcant way to a community that is not
(in all other relevant respects) fully just -- at least if they are
amongst those who are disadvantaged by their society's residual
injustices. Reciprocity kicks in, as it were, only when the terms of
social co-operation are fair, where ['fairness' requires]{.underline}
(*inter alia*[) full satisfaction]{.underline} of the demands of [equal
opportunity]{.underline}. If equal opportunity is understood in our
assumed sense, however, then [this full compliance view]{.underline}
effectively [removes]{.underline} the ideal of [fair reciprocity from
the domain of real-world politics]{.underline}. [For there is no chance
that any advanced capitalist]{.underline} (or, for that matter,
post-capitalist[) society will in the near future satisfy equal
opportunity,]{.underline} in our assumed sense, in full. And so,
following the full compliance view, [we should, if we are
egalitarians]{.underline} in the assumed sense, [simply abandon the
idea]{.underline} that [there can be]{.underline} anything like a
[universal civic obligation to make a productive contribution to the
community.]{.underline}

Jan **Narveson** -- P.hD @ Harvard University 19**97** "Egalitarianism:

[Egalitarians can only defend their view by reference to values
that]{.underline} many or [most people do not have. People below the
mid-point of the proposed redistributional scale]{.underline} will, of
course, [have]{.underline} some [reason to rejoice at their unearned
egalitarian windfalls -- temporarily. Meanwhile, people from whom they
are wrested have the opposite motivation, so common good is out the
window]{.underline} from the start[. Nor can equality relevantly be held
to be an 'objective']{.underline} or an 'absolute' value -- a value in
itself, that doesn't need to be held byanybody (except the theorist
himself, of course). That is intuitional talk, which has already been
dismissed. [Do real people]{.underline} (as opposed to theorists) [care
about equality as such? No. They want better]{.underline} and more
reliable food on the table, nicer tables to put it on, [TV's, theatres,
motorcars]{.underline}, books, medical services, churches, courses in
Chinese history, and so on, indefi- nitely. [Equality is irrelevant to
these values: how much of any or all of them anyone has is logically
independent of how much anyone else has. People are rarely free of
envy,]{.underline} to be sure. [Most people would like to be better than
others in some way]{.underline} -- and some will pay others to let them
look down on them. [But few will make themselves worse off in order to
make some other people equally badly off.]{.underline} Values that can
be improved by human activity are not independent in any other way,
though, for production is cooperative, requiring arrangements agreed to
by a great many people -- work- ers, financiers, engineers, customers.
[Nobody can attain to wealth]{.underline}, insofar as the free market
obtains, [without others likewise benefiting.]{.underline} [These are
truisms]{.underline}, though I am aware that they will be seen by many
readers as 'ideological' -- [even]{.underline} at the present time,
[when]{.underline} the absurdities of [alternative views of economics

of Dworkin\'s use of idealized markets. Dworkin argues that the initial
division of resources (prior to adjustments made in light of differences
in individual ambition) should satisfy an \"envy test\": [\"No division
of resources is an equal division if, once the division is complete, any
\[person\] would prefer someone else\'s bundle of resources to his own
bundle\"]{.underline} (Dworkin 1981b, 285). And the mechanism he
proposes to satisfy this test is a hypothetical auction in which
individuals bid on resources using some counter (itself without value
and equally distributed). [This market-based solution values resources
entirely in terms of the preferences that individuals express in the
auction]{.underline}. Macleod recognizes that a great strength of
Dworkin\'s auction is that it is sensitive to the opportunity costs to
others of giving some re- source to a particular individual. As Macleod
helpfully points out, [\"The resources a person can acquire are a
function not only of the importance she attaches to them but also of the
importance attached by others to them]{.underline} \.... Phrased in the
language of opportunity costs, the auction ensures that aggregate
opportunity costs are equal\" (26).

Suppose, again, that the sufficiency level for all was 50. Whereas
intrinsic egalitarianism seems, other things being equal, to favour
outcome (3) and prioritarianism would favour allocation (1),
sufficientarianism would favour outcome (2) since this would be the only
outcome in which at least some people had enough. For [the
sufficientarian, the distribution of benefits and burdens to achieve
equality or priority in such circumstances is indefensible]{.underline}.
It would be analogous to the tragedy involved in a famine situation of
giving food to those who cannot possibly survive at the cost of those
that could survive if they received extra rations. In this sense, [the
ideal of sufficiency is related to the medical concept of 'triage'
according to which, when faced with more people requiring care than can
be treated, resources are rationed so that the most needy receive
attention first. However, because the category of 'most needy' is
defined in terms of the overarching aim that as many people as possible
should survive a given emergency, triage protocols often lead to the
very worst off being denied treatment for the sake of benefitting those
who can be helped to survive.]{.underline} Frankfurt's view is [that all
distributive claims arise in some way from an analysis of where people
stand relative to the threshold of sufficiency,]{.underline} or as he
puts it the 'threshold that separates lives that are good from lives
that are not good' (Frankfurt 1997, p. 6). [Egalitarianism, by contrast,
posits a relationship between the urgency of a person's claims and their
comparative well-being without reference to the level at which they
would have enough. Since allocating people enough to lead decent lives
exhausts our duties of distribution, sufficientarians argue that
egalitarianism recognizes duties that do not exist. In fact, in linking
ethical duties to the comparative fortunes of people, egalitarianism
encourages envy and thereby contributes 'to the moral disorientation and
shallowness of our time']{.underline} (Frankfurt 1987, pp. 22--23;
Anderson 1999, pp. 287ff.).

Although Frankfurt focuses his [critique of rival distributive views on
intrinsic egalitarianism, it can be readily extended to cover
prioritarianism.]{.underline} While the priority view is grounded in the
badness of absolute rather than comparative disadvantage, it is also
inclined to divert resources to the worst off even if this would mean
sacrificing substantial benefits to other, slightly better off, persons
who could be helped to lead a decent life. Frankfurt argues that[: It is
true that people in the lowest strata of society generally live in
horrible conditions, but this association of low social position and
dreadful quality of life is entirely contingent. There is no necessary
connection between being at the bottom of society and being poor in the
sense in which poverty is a serious and morally objectionable barrier to
life.]{.underline} (Frankfurt 1997, p. 2) [The problem with
prioritarianism, then, is not that it fetishizes comparative wellbeing
but rather that it fetishizes absolute well-being with the result that
it mandates constant interference in people's lives to benefit the worst
off. By doing so, prioritarianism is inclined to generate just as much
envy and pity as its egalitarian rival and to mandate a range of
redistributions that do not help their recipients to lead decent lives.
C]{.underline}onsider the following example. There are two groups in
society, where one enjoys a considerably lower level of well-being than
the other, where both groups enjoy a far better than decent life, and
where the inequalities are undeserved. We can call these groups the
'very happy' and the 'extremely happy'. Egalitarians claim that, if we
could do something about it, the very happy group should be compensated
for their relative well-being deficit. This is because this theory
regards undeserved inequality as bad even if everyone is at least very
happy; that is, it makes no ethical difference that the inequality is
between groups, or persons, who are very well off. Prioritarians, by
contrast, regard the very happy in isolation of their relative happiness
as they are only interested in absolute levels of well-being.
Nonetheless, the very happy, as the worst off, deserve our attention
even if their lives are so good they want for nothing. **[According to
sufficientarians, however, the egalitarian and prioritarian claims are
absurd. How can there be a duty to help the worst off, they ask, when
they already lead lives of such a high standard?]{.underline}**

If Rawls's appeal to the burdens of judgment seems disingenuous [insofar
as the founding moment of justice as fairness is somehow protected from
them]{.underline}, his underlying notion of citizenship also leaves much
to be desired. Even though he claims "citizens learn and profit from
conflict and argument" (Rawls 1993: lvii), [he methodically closes
spaces for the types of dissent, conflict and argument that nurture
democratic citizenship]{.underline}. If citizens with competing
comprehensive doctrines happen to meet on the street in Rawls's liberal
utopia, they nervously grimace at each other and then retreat to the
private sphere, simply shrugging shoulders in silence during encounters.
Both [the immediate impact]{.underline} and the intergenerational effect
[of Rawls's neutralization of public dialogue will produce a society of
inarticulate shoppers on Proza]{.underline}c: "By taking Prozac, they
may be able to alleviate their angst, which might be a disruptive force
to the liberal order" (Alejandro 1998: 13). [Citizens will not only be
unable to contest abuses of power but they will be incapable of
negotiating encounters with others in substantive ways. Rawls's allergy
to]{.underline} even mild modes of [political conflict results in a
de-politicization of politics]{.underline} under the banner of
neutrality.35 [He evacuates all political content from public
discussion: "]{.underline}We try to bypass religion and philosophy's
pro- foundest controversies so as to have some hope of uncover- ing a
basis of a stable overlapping consensus" (Rawls 1993: 152).36Much to his
credit, Rawls acknowledges the great deal of indeterminacy of decision
in the burdens of judgment but this indeterminacy is somehow absent from
his image of political society. [The indeterminacy of
decision]{.underline} in Rawls [is mitigated by his de-politicization of
political foundations]{.underline}. The indeterminacy of politics is
precisely what Rawls seeks to expel from the political horizon.
[Political liberalism purges politics from politics and encloses the
political field under the terror of uniformit]{.underline}y.37The value

[How will democratic decision makers choose which welfare policy to
endorse]{.underline}? [They will speculate]{.underline}. The average
voter, for example, will have no option other than guessing which policy
has the best long- term consequences, and the average elected
representative is probably in no better position. In speculating about
long-term consequences they may be inordinately swayed by any number of
prejudices or pre- conceived ideas. [When the truth does not present
itself clearly, it is easy to seize on the evidence that supports one\'s
ideological presuppositions. The consequence of applying equality of
fortune to the welfare debate is not usefully neutral in the sense that
it avoids blind ideological presuppositions or commitments. It is
tragically neutral in]{.underline} the sense [that it
provides]{.underline} democratic voters and their representatives with
[no reason to challenge]{.underline} their [blind ideological
commitments]{.underline}. For [equality of fortune would focus the
debate on the empirical questio]{.underline}n that did, in fact, command
the lion\'s share of attention: Which policy is best for the poor?
Answers to this question will be [determined by prejudice and mood more
than reasoned deliberation or real debate]{.underline}. [If this
consequence is inevitable, then the implications for the ideal of
equality are dismal]{.underline}: [it would appear impotent as a
political ideal]{.underline}, for it requires democratic bodies to make
decisions based on speculation about economic effects over the course of
decades or even generations.

Thomas **Weiss '99**, Presidential Professor of Political Science @ CUNY
Graduate Center, \"principles, politics, and humanitarian action\"

Political actors have a newfound interest in principles, while
humanitari- ans of all stripes are increasingly aware of the importance
of politics. [Yet, there remain two distinct approaches---politics and
humanitarianism as self-contained and antithetical
realities]{.underline} or alternatively as overlapping spheres.
Nostalgia for aspects of the Cold War or other bygone eras is perhaps
under- standable, but [there never was a "golden age" when
humanitarianism was insulated from politics]{.underline}. Much aid was
an extension of the foreign policies of major donors, especially the
superpowers. Nonetheless, it was easieq conceptually and practically, to
compartmentalize humanitarianism and politics before the present decade.
Then, a better guide to action was provided by an unflinching respect
for traditional princi- ples, although they never were absolute ends but
only intermediate means. [In today's world, humanitarians must ask
themselves how to weigh the political consequences of their action or
inaction]{.underline}; and politicians must ask them- selves how to
gauge the humanitarian costs of their action or inaction[. The cal-
culations are tortuous, and the mathematics far from exact.]{.underline}
However, there is no longer any need to ask *whether* politics and
humanitarian action intersect. [The real question is how this
intersection can be managed to ensure more humanized
politics]{.underline} and more effective humanitarian action. [To this
end, humanitarians should be neither blindly principled nor blindly
pragmatic]{.underline}.

## Egalitarianism isn't democratic---inevitable dilemma  {#egalitarianism-isnt-democraticinevitable-dilemma .Tags}

Fabienne [Peter]{.underline} -- Ph.D. in Economics -- 13 November
20[06]{.underline} "The Political Egalitarian's Dilemma" Springer Link

The dilemma is the following. If, on the one hand, the substantive
constraints on the deliberative process are kept to a minimum, only a
weak criterion of political equality can be imposed on the deliberative
process. This criterion may fail to ensure the effective equality of
participants in the deliberative process, which undermines the
legitimacy of the outcomes of such a process. [If,]{.underline} on the
other hand[, political equality is interpreted comprehensively, many
substantive judgments will be packed into the conditions imposed on the
deliberative process]{.underline}. They will be treated as exempt from
deliberative evaluation. [The stronger the criterion of political
equality, the more emphasis]{.underline} is placed not just on general
political resources, but [on people's abilities to make effective use of
these resources, the narrower the scope for democratic scrutiny. This,
again, jeopardizes democratic legitimacy]{.underline}. Thus, [a strong
criterion of political equality, which focuses on people's possibilities
to participate in the deliberative process as effectively equals, will
fail to ensure democratic legitimacy because it will exempt too many
value judgments from deliberative democratic scrutiny.]{.underline} A
weak criterion of political equality will fail to ensure democratic
legitimacy because many will not have been able to participate in the
deliberative process as effectively equals. In other words, [the
political egalitarian's dilemma reveals a clash between the attempt to
ensure equal possibilities to participate in the democratic process and
the requirement of subjecting substantive judgments to deliberative
evaluation.]{.underline}

## Egalitarianism hurts the poor  {#egalitarianism-hurts-the-poor .Tags}

Jan **Narveson** -- P.hD @ Harvard University 19**97** "Egalitarianism:
Partial, Counterproductive and Baseless" Blackwell

[Further reflection]{.underline} on [this leads to an important further
point against egalitarianism]{.underline}: [that it is
essentially]{.underline} certain to be [counterproductive]{.underline}
as well -- [to defeat the very values whose equalization is required by
the theor]{.underline}y[. Forced transfers from rich to
poor]{.underline}, from capitalists to proletarians, will [worsen the
lot of the poor even as it decreases the wealth of the
rich.]{.underline} Not only is egalitarianism biased, but the particular
people against whom it is biased are the productive-- the source of what
the people it is biased in favour of hope to receive in consequence. It
is not too much to say, even, that egalitarianism is a conspiracy
against those it claims to be trying to help. There is a reason for
this, whose incomprehension by philosophers even to this day should be a
matter of astonishment. A free economy is one in which no one forcibly
intervenes against the property rights of any other -- all are free to
use their resources as they judge best, including engaging in commercial
exchanges. In such a system, the only ways to achieve wealth are by
means which improve the situations of others. Successful businesspeople
become so by organizing or financially supporting the production of
things that other people want, and want more than the existing
alternatives -- since those people, having no obligation to buy, would
not otherwise buy them. The only other possibilities are fairly
uninteresting: gift, and the discovery or 'original acquisition' of
valuable things. But gift, as such, is pure transfer and does not create
wealth, except in the form of good will[. We may praise occasional acts
of charity, but if everyone were only charitable and
unproductive]{.underline}, [all]{.underline}, [including the
poor]{.underline} and sick, [would quickly die.]{.underline} And as to
acquisition, [if we would attain to wealth, those items must be
harnessed to human use]{.underline} -- [nature does not afford a free
lunch]{.underline} any more than our fellows. Even someone who acquired
a natural beauty spot, say, and keeps it natural, will be able to make a
decent living thereby only if he is able to charge others for the right
to enjoy that spot. And so on.

## No such thing as a utilitarian defense of egalitarianism  {#no-such-thing-as-a-utilitarian-defense-of-egalitarianism .Tags}

Jan **Narveson** -- P.hD @ Harvard University 19**97** "Egalitarianism:
Partial, Counterproductive and Baseless" Blackwell

[An]{.underline} immensely popular [argument, thought to provide a clear
utilitarian defense for egalitarianism, appeals to a principle of
'diminishing marginal utility]{.underline}.' The idea is that the
marginal return from possession of some measurable good decreases as a
function of the amount one already has -- money being the most familiar
and obvious case in point. From this it is inferred that general utility
will be promoted by transferring such goods from those above the
midpoint to those below, where the marginal util- ity of unit increments
is much greater. [Two major flaws destroy this argument]{.underline}.
The first is fundamental:[general]{.underline} (aggregate) [utility
simply isn't a common value, and therefore cannot be appealed
to.]{.underline} Individuals are not necessarily concerned to promote
the aggregate sum of good. They are mostly concerned to promote the
goods of certain particular persons -- themselves, friends, countrymen,
whatever -- and not the sum of utility, even if that sum could be
objectively deter- mined. It is therefore inadmissible to appeal to it.
[Only if the particular individual addressed can be shown that what
matters to himwill be forwarded if the aggregate of utility
grows]{.underline} -- some- times plausible, to be sure -- [is he
rationally interested in its growth. That special case apart,
utilitarian arguments are dismissed.]{.underline} Second, and more
important for present purposes, [the argu- ment suffers from myopia: it
focuses only on the consumptionutil- ity of money.]{.underline} But all
good things come from somewhere: namely, human effort and know-how.
Allocation of those requires invest- ment. [But the poor, obviously, do
not invest -- the better-off do that.]{.underline} A well-invested
dollar yields goods and services in the future greatly exceeding the
stock of consumption goods one could buy with the same money[. The
marginal utility of dollars in the upper incomes is therefore greater,
not less, than the marginal utility of dollars for the
poor.]{.underline}

Perhaps the simplest theory of the pattern of justice is that benefits
and burdens should be distributed across some population so that
inequality is minimized. We might call this view ['intrinsic
egalitarianism' as it holds that inequality is bad or
unjust]{.underline} (I use these terms interchangeably[) in itself and
not because of its consequences]{.underline}. As Temkin has put it, the
essence of intrinsic equality is that 'it is bad for some to be worse
off than others through no fault of their own' (Temkin 2003, p. 62). It
[is worth contrasting intrinsic equality with some closely associated
views. Utilitarians hold that acts and social policies should be
evaluated only in terms of their consequences and that these
consequences ought to promote the maximum amount of welfare possible.
Depending on the circumstances the utilitarian may prefer an equal
distribution of well-being because this coincides with the desire to
maximize welfare]{.underline}. The reason for this is that it is
generally easier to help the worse off than others---one only has to
give them a little for their welfare level to improve a lot. In this
sense, **[utilitarians are 'accidental', rather than intrinsic,
egalitarians.]{.underline}**

In short[, successful investment enhances the lot of others in society.
When people are employed, this enhances their real incomes]{.underline},
more than any other opportunities they may have had. [And when they
spend their money, it is because they judge that expenditure to
contribute maximally to their well-being. Thus, if we wrest the gains
from investment or well-paid work from the investors and workers in
question, we take from the productive and transfer to the
unproductive.]{.underline} This takes money that would have produced
more and ensures that it will be used in less productive ways[. A large
society that undertakes this kind of activity extensively decrees
poverty for itself]{.underline}, in comparison with what it could have
done instead in a freed-up market. [And it is the poor, above all, who
benefit,]{.underline} relatively speaking, from commercial activity --
[activ- ity that, if unimpeded, continually drives down prices,
continually finds new employment for available labour, and continually
real- locates resources in the way that does most good for most
people,]{.underline} as indicated by the actual choices and preferences
of those people.11

Therefore, [sufficientarianism is an alternative to economic
egalitarianism]{.underline}. Sufficientarianism presents the idea of
sufficiency as an alternative to the idea of economic equality. The
essence of sufficientarianism is to show that the idea of economic
equality has no intrinsic value. According to sufficientarianism, when
people consider what is important for their own lives, the amount of
goods owned by other people becomes irrelevant. Instead, comparison with
the amount of goods owned by others prevents people from seeking what
they consider valuable for themselves. [It is unnecessary to attach
moral significance to economic egalitarianism]{.underline}. While
Frankfurt enumerates some reasons for the failure of economic
egalitarianism, he indicates that egalitarians do not actually defend
the idea of equality, as indicated by the priority view. In other words,
[egalitarians' objections are not based on their moral aversion to a
person holding a smaller amount of goods as compared to other
people]{.underline}. In reality, [their objection is to the fact that
the person owns only a remarkably small amount of goods.]{.underline}
This naturally gives rise to the following questions. What does
sufficiency imply? What is the standard of sufficiency? Although
Frankfurt does not define the meaning of sufficiency in concrete terms,
it does not imply that sufficientarianism is pointless. Indeed, the
meaning of sufficiency can be defined in various ways. However, [the
essence of sufficientarianism is to seek what one finds valuable in
his/her life and not compare the amount of goods one owns with that of
others; this is crucial to judge sufficiency]{.underline}.

Irrespective of the definition of sufficiency selected,
sufficientarianism cannot justify distribution to those whose
circumstances are above the standard of sufficiency. Therefore[, it does
not lead to the implausible conclusion that goods should be distributed
to millionaires in a society that comprises only billionaires and
millionaires. Sufficientarianism]{.underline}, which [rejects economic
egalitarianism and simultaneously requires distribution to those below
the standard of sufficiency,]{.underline} is consistent with moderate
libertarianism or classical liberalism, which rejects distribution aimed
at reducing income disparity and admits the necessity of distribution
that guarantees a minimum standard of living. Indeed, the interpretation
of sufficientarianism that I present in this paper might conflict with
the original intention of sufficientarians. As we have seen, I support
sufficientarianism. Despite differences between

sufficientarianism and the priority view, I re-emphasize the fact that
they have a common crucial viewpoint regarding egalitarianism. They
share the belief that being worse off than others does not have moral
significance in terms of the ethics of distribution. While the idea of
equality that emphasizes relativity with others is set as a default
position in the argument on distribution, both theories demand criticism
of the above assumption. [Egalitarians often confuse equality with
priority or sufficiency; however, it is important to bear in mind that
the apparent plausibility of egalitarianism is derived from its
humanitarian appeal.]{.underline} The point I wish to emphasize is that
absolute poverty, and not relative poverty, is important. Next, before
turning to an examination of the connection between sufficientarianism
and libertarianism, I shall consider the necessity of highlighting the
abuse of egalitarianism.

[In contrast to egalitarians and prioritarians, some
theorists]{.underline}, such as Harry Frankfurt, [hold that benefits and
burdens should be distributed in line with the 'doctrine of
sufficiency'. This states that as many people as possible should have
enough (of the currency of justice adopted) to pursue the aims and
aspirations they care about over a whole life; and that **this aim has
lexical priority over other ideals of justice**]{.underline} (Frankfurt
1987, pp. 21--43; 1997, pp. 3--14). Attaining what we really care about,
for Frankfurt, requires [a certain level of well-being, but once this
level is reached there is no further relationship between how well-off a
person is and whether they discover and fulfil what it is that they
really care about.]{.underline} Frankfurt holds that, above the level of
sufficiency, it is neither reasonable to seek a higher standard of
living nor expect, as amatter of justice, any additional allocation of
some currency of justice to further improve their prospects[. It is
important to add that 'having enough' is not the same as living a
'tolerable' life in the sense that one does not regret one's existence.
Rather it means a person leads a life that contains no substantial
dissatisfaction.]{.underline} According to Frankfurt, **[the flaw in
intrinsic egalitarianism 'lies in supposing that it is morally important
whether one person has less than another regardless of how much either
of them has']{.underline} (**Frankfurt 1987, p. 34). [What
matters,]{.underline} Frankfurt argues[, 'is not that everyone should
have the same but that each should have enough. If everyone had enough
it would be of no moral consequence whether some had more than
others']{.underline} (Frankfurt 1987, p. 21; original emphasis). This
does not mean, however, that egalitarian and prioritarian concerns will
always frustrate sufficiency since each and every person should be
helped to the threshold of sufficiency if possible, and those who can be
helped to lead a decent life are often among the worst off in a
population. [But the aim of reducing inequality, or of improving the
position of the worst off, has no intrinsic value for
sufficientarians.]{.underline}

One way of responding to the problems raised by these two examples would
be to construct a '[pluralist' approach to distributive justice.
Pluralism, in this context, means that we would appeal to contrasting
ideals in different contexts]{.underline} (Daniels 1996, p. 208). There
are three possibilities, which I can only sketch here. First, the ideals
could apply in different distributive circumstances. For example, [we
might give lexical priority to sufficiency when at least some can be
brought up to the threshold, but appeal to equality or priority when all
are above, or all below, the threshold]{.underline} (Crisp 2003, pp.
758ff.). Second, [sufficiency might be allocated non-lexical priority
over other values so that large gains in these values will sometimes
outweigh lesser gains in sufficiency.]{.underline} Arneson has usefully
labeled [this 'moderate sufficientarianism']{.underline} (Arneson 2006,
p. 28). The strength of this view is that it can explain why we should
opt for (2) over (1) since it **[offers tremendous gains in both
equality and priority with no adverse impact on
sufficiency.]{.underline}** Similarly, though more controversially,
moderate sufficientarians have at least some reason to opt for (4) over
(3) since [great benefits arise, in terms of equality and priority, if
we ignore the sufficiency of the few for the prize of giving major
benefits to the many]{.underline}. Third, we might subsume one ideal
under another while attributing some degree of intrinsic value to the
subsumed ideal. [Sufficientarians generally view inequality as
regrettable because of its consequences, such as the way in which it
inhibits economic growth, undermines political processes, or is a malign
influence on cultural life.]{.underline} Yet, there is a more subtle way
that inequality matters. This is that some people might fail to reach
the standards of a decent life if they are continually faced with the
discomfiture that many others are far better off. Similarly, some people
might fall below the threshold of sufficiency if they begin to enjoy
life less as a result of identifying with the resentment of others who
are worse off (Marmor 2003, pp. 127ff).

(David Kelley, Ph.D, Princeton University, philosopher, author, founder
and senior fellow of the Atlas Society, 98, [A Life of One's Own:
Individual Rights and the Welfare State]{.underline}, p 151)

We have examined the nature of welfare rights, their history, and the
philosophical case for them. We have examined the arguments for
believing in such rights and seen how the many issues they raise play
out in the concrete reality of welfare programs. The conclusion can no
longer be resisted: the concept of welfare rights is invalid. There is
**no warrant** **for claiming rights to** **food, shelter, and medical
care, to income maintenance, child support, and retirement pensions, at
taxpayer expense**. Such rights cannot be justified by appeal to
freedom, to benevolence, or to community. They do not expand but curtail
freedom---that of program clients as well as of taxpayers. They make
charity compulsory, undermining any genuine benevolence donors might
have toward the poor. They replace the voluntary bonds of a society of
contract with the coercive power of the state, undermining genuine
community. The concept does not provide a valid rationale for the
welfare state; it provides a mere rationalization for the coercive
transfer of wealth. If we want a system based on genuine rights, one
that promotes genuine human welfare, we should privatize or simply
terminate the government programs. In place of \"social insurance,\" the
market can provide real and affordable insurance to protect against the
risk of illness, accidents, disability, and unemployment. And for
retirement, as we saw in the last chapter, private savings instruments
provide a much better return than most people can expect from Social
Security. At the very least, people should be allowed to opt out of the
social insurance programs, forgoing the benefits to which they would
otherwise be entitled in exchange for exemption from payroll taxes. A
number of plans have been put forward to allow opting out without
harming the interests of current retirees.

## Health care policies are coercive. {#health-care-policies-are-coercive. .Tags}

**Bissell**, The Objectivist Center, **No Date**

(Andrew Bissell, The Objectivist Center, No Date, "Health Care - Is it a
right?"
http://www.objectivistcenter.org/ct-1297-Right_To_Health_Care.aspx)

First, it is very important not to conflate the right to life with a
right to health care. The right to life is central to the Objectivist
ethics and politics, and health care is certainly essential to
maintaining one's life. However, as Rand puts it: "A right does not
include the material implementation of that right by other men; it
includes only the freedom to earn that implementation by one's own
effort." (\"Man's Rights\", The Virtue of Selfishness, pp. 113-114) In
this sense, an apt comparison can be drawn to the right of free speech;
your right to speak your mind does not create some obligation on the
part of others to support that expression, financially or otherwise. Ayn
Rand unmasks the fallacy at the root of the "right to health care" and
all other such economic rights: "A single question ... would make the
issue clear: At whose expense?" (\"Man's Rights\", The Virtue of
Selfishness, p. 113) Health care doesn't simply grow on trees; if it is
to be made a right for some, the means to provide that right must be
confiscated from others. Health care exists because of the efforts of
doctors, nurses, medical technicians, and even the engineers who design
and build lifesaving machines. There are really only a few ways, then,
that it can be provided. These medical personnel can offer their
services as part of a mutual exchange of benefit for benefit, in a
system of free, market exchange. Or, they can be forced to provide these
services at the point of a gun, as in the movie John Q. Or, the
government can arrogate to itself the title of the sole health care
provider, funding its operations through forced taxation. The problems
with forcing doctors to treat patients are obvious---first, of course,
it requires wanton violation of their rights, and represents government
enforcement of the principle that a doctor's life is not his own, but
instead belongs to the state or the community. And no one will want to
enter the medical profession when the reward for years of careful
schooling and study is not fair remuneration, but rather, patients who
feel entitled to one's efforts, and a government that enslaves the very
minds upon which patients' lives depend.

## Free health care means slavery. {#free-health-care-means-slavery. .Tags}

Brown, Staff Writer, 04

(John Brown, Staff Writer, The Daily Beacon, Senior in Political
Science, 9/28/04,
http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1229567/posts)

A \"right\" is the ability and autonomy to perform a sovereign action.
In a free society founded on the ideal of liberty, an individual has an
absolute ability to perform such an action - so long as it does not
infringe upon the rights of another individual. Health care is not
speech: In order for you to exercise a theoretical \"right\" to health
care, you must infringe on someone else\'s rights. If you have a
\"right\" to health care, then it means you must also have the right to
coerce doctors into treating you, to coerce drug companies into
producing medicine and to coerce other citizens into footing your
medical bill. This is Orwellian. \"Freedom\" for you cannot result in
slavery for others. Thus the concept of a \"right\" to health care is an
oxymoron: It involves tak\[es\] away the rights of other individuals.

Surely, though, we can agree that doctors, the pharmaceutical industry
and insurance companies earn excessive profits, you say. Well, that
depends on what your definition of \"excessive\" is. Doctors literally
hold the lives of their patients in their hands. How much is someone who
saves lives everyday worth? The same is true of pharmaceutical
companies. While it has become fashionable to condemn their profits, the
fact is that these profits fund medical research, which leads to more
medicines being produced, and, consequently, more lives saved. Insurance
companies spread the cost of health care among many people who might not
otherwise be able to afford it, and thus make health care readily
available for many.

Dehumanization, of a sort, is yet one more inevitable consequence of the
sheer size and structure of the modern state. There is simply no way for
the agents of an organization claiming to \"serve\" hundreds of
thousands (or hundreds of millions!) of people to know anything about
the vast majority of those individuals beyond some disembodied entries
on a tax return, or an arbitrary accounting convenience like a Social
Security number. To borrow a phrase often used by critics of large
private enterprises, the modern state is \"beyond human scale.\"

Another, more insidious, form of dehumanization is inseparable from the
political process that is the very essence of the state. To see this,
let\'s first consider the most extreme act of the state: war. In order
to break down people\'s natural resistance to the killing of other human
beings, states have historically made dehumanization of the enemy one of
the major components of their war propaganda. With the enemy reduced to
less-than-human status, it\'s easier to justify the use of lethal force
against him.

At this point, we have discussed how the law denies a person's humanity.
However, it creates something new in its place, since \"\[a\]t each
instant of its intervention, this law creates something new. Every
situation is transformed by its intervention.\" The re-creation of an
individual depends on what will best eliminate discordant ideas, since
\"\[a\] discordant statement \[is\] unknown in law.\" This may be seen
as Lacan's way of saying \`that the law as a master will do what it must
to preserve its power, that is, to preserve \"the existing relations of
production and the moral and social order.\" Therefore, if society views
minorities as criminal, then the PSG will shape itself to fulfill that
prophesy. If judges are seen as abusive of their discretion in judging,
then the FSG will create judges that are \"mere automatons, permitted
only to apply a mathematical formula.\" lf the Sentencing Commission
becomes sympathetic toward the idea of downward departures and the rigid
strictures of PROTECT, then Congress will create a Commission that
becomes a mere tool for a tough-on-crime policy of sentence increases.
The master wants uniformity, predictability, and severity, and will
censor and recreate others in its drive to achieve these goals.

http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&id=5316&news_iv_ctrl=1021\]
-=Max Rispoli=-

Every doctor, like individuals in other jobs, has a right to work for
himself and for his own enjoyment, and to make a ton of money at it if
he can. As individuals, doctors have a right to offer their patients
treatment according to their best judgment, and to charge such fees as
they judge their expertise to be worth. Conversely, patients have the
right to accept or reject our advice and services, and to shop around
for the best deals they can get. Having the right to your life does not
guarantee health or medical treatment at the doctors\' expense, but it
does guarantee that every individual has the freedom to seek whatever
treatment he wishes, according to his own judgment and his own means.
Individual rights means the freedom to act within one\'s means; it does
not mean an entitlement to the goods and services provided by others.
However, not only have American doctors been stripped of their
professional freedom by all the various oversight agencies (which
include licensing boards, the Health Care Financing Administration,
managed care companies, peer review committees and more), but\--more
important\--they have also been morally disarmed. Our intellectuals have
taught doctors that need comes before ability, and that healthy and rich
doctors have a duty to support sick and poor patients. They have taught
doctors that the consumers of medical services (patients) are morally
superior to the providers of medical services (doctors), just because
the consumers are in need. Bureaucrats have eagerly latched on to this
altruistic idea, and have erected a maze of welfare laws and regulations
to satisfy the needs of the poor and the sick, and to \"protect\" them
from \"greedy\" doctors. Thanks to these controls, it has become very
difficult for doctors to think or to act freely on their own judgment.
And it is the best doctors, the most dedicated and those least ready to
relinquish their independent judgment, who have been the first to leave
the practice of medicine when doctors\' rights were trampled on. Who
will ultimately be left if this trend continues? To quote Dr. Hendricks
in Ayn Rand\'s novel Atlas Shrugged, \"Let them discover, in their
operating rooms and hospital wards, that it is not safe to place their
lives in the hands of a man whose life they have throttled. It is not
safe, if he is the sort of man who resents it\--and still less safe, if
he is the sort who doesn\'t.\" To save American medicine, American
doctors need to be saved from altruism. To accomplish this, doctors must
vigorously challenge the invalid notion of a \"right\" to health care.
Nobody has a right to an antibiotic made by someone else, just as he
does not have a right to someone else\'s car. Nobody has a right to have
his gallbladder removed, just as he does not have a right to have his
toilet fixed by a plumber. No one has a right to demand that a doctor
treat him, but doctors do have rights, just as do auto workers and
plumbers, to practice their profession (or trade) free from coercion.

University) January 15, 19**96**. THE ARGUMENT FOR FREE MARKETS:
MORALITY VS. EFFICIENCY.
http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj15n2-3-3.html

Justice: Process vs. Results

[At the heart of most interventionist policy is a vision of justice.
Most often this vision evaluates the presence of justice by looking at
results.]{.underline} Social justice has considerable appeal and as such
is used as justification for interventionist statism. There are several
criticisms of the concept of social justice that Hayek has answered
well, but [defenders of personal liberty must make a greater effort to
demystify the term and show that justice or fairness cannot be
determined by examining results.]{.underline} [The results people often
turn to in order to determine the presence or absence of justice are
educational and occupational status, income, life expectancy, and other
socioeconomic factors. But justice or fairness cannot be determined by
results. It is a process question. Consider]{.underline}, for example,
that three individuals play [a]{.underline} regular [game of
poker]{.underline}. [The typical game outcome is: individual A wins 75
percent of the time, while individuals B and C win 15 percent and 10
percent of the time]{.underline}, respectively. [By knowing the game\'s
result, nothing unambiguous can be said about whether there has been
\"poker justice.\'\']{.underline} [Individual A\'s disproportionate
winnings are consistent with his being an astute player, clever cheater,
or just plain lucky. The only way one can determine whether there has
been poker justice is to examine the game\'s process.]{.underline}
Process questions would include: [Did the players play
voluntarily]{.underline}? [Were the poker rules neutral and unbiasedly
applied? Was the game played without cheating? If the process were just,
affirmative answers would be given]{.underline} to those three questions
and there would be poker justice irrespective of the outcome. [Thus,
justice is really a process issue]{.underline}. [The most popular
justification for the interventionist state is to create or ensure
fairness and justice in the distribution of income.]{.underline}
Considerable confusion, obfuscation, and demagoguery regarding the
sources of income provide statists with copious quantities of ammunition
to justify their redistributionist agenda. [Income is not distributed.
In a free society, income is earned. People serving one another through
the provision of goods and services generate income. We serve our fellow
man in myriad ways]{.underline}. We bag his groceries, teach his
children, entertain him, and heal his wounds. [By doing so, we
receive]{.underline} \"certificates of performance.\'\' In the United
States, we call these certificates [dollars]{.underline}. Elsewhere they
are called pesos, francs, marks, yen, and pounds. [Those certificates
stand as]{.underline} evidence ([proof) of our service. The more
valuable our service to our fellow man]{.underline} (as he determines),
[the greater the number of certificates of performance we
receive]{.underline} and hence the greater our claim on goods and
services. [That free-market process promotes a moral discipline that
says: Unless we are able and willing to serve our fellow man, we shall
have no claim on what he produces. Contrast that moral discipline to the
immorality of the welfare state]{.underline}. In effect [the welfare
state says: You do not have to serve your fellow man; through
intimidation, threats, and coercion, we will take what he produces and
give it to you.]{.underline} The vision that sees income as being
\"distributed\'\' implies a different scenario for the sources of income
never made explicit. [The vision that sees income as being distributed
differs little from asserting that out there is a dealer of dollars. It
naturally leads to the conclusion that if some people have fewer dollars
than others, the dollar dealer is unfair]{.underline}; he is a racist,
sexist, or a multi-nationalist. [Therefore, justice and fairness require
a re-dealing]{.underline} (income redistribution) [of dollars. That way
the ill-gotten gains of the few are returned to their \"rightful\'\'
owners. That vision is the essence of the results-oriented view of
justice underpinning the welfare state]{.underline}. People who
criticize the existing distribution of income as being unfair and demand
government redistribution are really criticizing the process whereby
income is earned. Their bottom line is that millions of individual
decision makers did not do the right thing. Consider the wealth of
billionaire [Bill Gates]{.underline}, the founder of MicroSoft. Gates
[earned billions because]{.underline} millions of [individuals
voluntarily spent their money on]{.underline} what they wanted\--[his
products. For someone to say that Gates\'s income is unfair is the same
as saying that the decisions of millions of consumers are
wrong]{.underline}. [To argue that Gates\'s income should be forcibly
taken and given to others is to say that somehow third parties have a
right to preempt voluntary decisions made by millions of
traders]{.underline}. When sources of income are viewed more
realistically, we reach the conclusion that [low income]{.underline},
for the most part, [is a result of people not having sufficient capacity
to serve their fellow man well rather than being victims of an unfair
process]{.underline}. Low[-income people simply do not have the skills
to produce and do things their fellow man highly values. Seldom do we
find poor highly productive individuals]{.underline} or nations. Those
who have low incomes tend to have low skills and education and hence low
productive capacity. Our challenge is to make those people (nations)
more productive. [Another explanation]{.underline} of low income [is
that the rules of the game have been rigged]{.underline}. [That is,
people do have an ability to provide goods and services valued by their
fellow man but are restricted from doing so. Among those rules are
minimum wage laws, occupational and business licensure laws and
regulations, and government-sponsored monopolies]{.underline}. [Hence,
another argument for free-market capitalism is that it is good for
low-income, low-skilled people.]{.underline}

Kristol and Wolfson are struggling, not just against the principles on
which America was founded, but against the modern world. It is
capitalism that has given us moderns so many choices. [Capitalism is the
economic system of free people]{.underline}; it is what happens when you
let people alone. [The virtues that capitalism rewards\--prudence,
discipline, initiative, self-reliance, new ideas\--and the affluence it
creates tend to push people in the direction of confidence in their own
abilities, skepticism about organized authority, and a desire to manage
their own affairs in all realms of life. That\'s why capitalism is not
in the long run compatible with political repression or governmental
restrictions on freedom.]{.underline}

[Freedom is]{.underline} also [necessary for the development of strong
moral character]{.underline}. Surely Kristol and Wolfson don\'t want to
undermine the bourgeois virtues, but the effect of restricting choice is
to eliminate the incentive and the opportunity for people to make good
choices and develop good habits. [People do not develop prudence,
self-reliance, thrift, and temperance when their choices are imposed by
force. Welfare-state liberals undermine moral character when they
subsidize indulgence in destructive choices]{.underline}.
[Big-government conservatives undermine character when they deny people
the right to shape their own characters through their
choices]{.underline}.

[Negative rights]{.underline} serve to [protect the individual, his
liberty, and his property from coercion and violence. Negative rights
prevent others from undertaking some types of actions, but they do not
oblige others to help one]{.underline}. [In order to safeguard negative
rights government has to be limited. The link between negative rights
and limited government was already well understood long before the term
"human rights" gained currency]{.underline}. In the late 17th century,
[Locke]{.underline} (\[1690\] 2003: 161, 189) [wrote: The supreme power
cannot take from any man part of his property without his own consent:
for the preservation of property being the end of
government]{.underline} . . . wherever the [power]{.underline}, that is
put in any hands for the government of the people, and the preservation
of their properties, is [applied to other ends, and made use of to
impoverish, harass, or subdue them into arbitrary and irregular commands
of those that have it; there it presently becomes tyranny, whether those
that thus use it are one or many]{.underline}.

[The right to life]{.underline} certainly is a fundamental human right.
It [is a negative right since it only requires that others do not kill
one]{.underline}. In this context, one should recall that about [169
million people have been killed by states or their governments in the
20th century]{.underline} (Rummel 1994). [Communists and National
Socialists established the most murderous regimes. Among the victims of
communism, there are tens of millions of deaths from starvation after
the coerced collectivization of agriculture in Stalin's Soviet Union or
Mao's China]{.underline}. Although the 20th century suffered two world
wars and other bloody wars, [fewer people died on the
battlefield]{.underline} or because of bombing campaigns [than have been
murdered or starved to death by their own governments. Whoever wants to
protect human rights should therefore first of all focus on the
necessity of protecting people from the state and its abuses of
power.]{.underline}

*Positive Rights*

[Positive rights or entitlements commit the state]{.underline} and its
officials [to]{.underline} undertake certain types of action---for
example, to [guarantee certain minimal standards of material
well-being]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} American [Bill of
Rights]{.underline} (1789) [is limited to negative or protective
rights,]{.underline} while the United Nations General Declaration of
Human Rights (1948) and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights
(2000) encompass both protective rights and entitlements.1 [The trend
from short lists of negative rights to long lists of negative and
positive rights has been accompanied by a rapid and sustained increase
in public spending]{.underline} in the West (Tanzi and Schuknecht 2000).

[Classical liberals, in contrast to people called "liberals" in 20th
century America]{.underline} and "social democrats" in Europe, [demanded
the primacy of individual liberty and thereby of protective rights and
limited government]{.underline}. [Providing people with entitlements
forces the state to curtail the negative rights and liberties of
individuals. In order to fund entitlements the state has to
tax]{.underline} (i.e., to take coercively from) some people in order to
provide for others. [Entitlements have to rest on coercion and
redistribution---that is, on a greater restriction of negative rights or
individual liberty than would otherwise be necessary. As]{.underline}
the balance of achievements and [victims]{.underline} [of communism
demonstrate]{.underline}s, the attempt to provide [entitlements did not
prevent tens of millions of deaths from starvation]{.underline}.
Actually, [the attempt to provide more than negative rights resulted
in]{.underline} something less: the [lack of respect of negative and
positive rights]{.underline}. As I shall argue, this association between
[the attempt to guarantee entitlements by a monopoly of coercion and
central planning is causally related to the repeated failure to protect
even the right to life]{.underline}.

(Nathaniel, psychotherapist, author, teacher, January 1995,
"Individualism and the Free Society, Part 2",
http://www.fff.org/freedom/0195d.asp)

Whatever the differences in their specific programs, all the enemies of
the free market economy-communists, socialists, fascists, welfare
statists-are unanimous in their belief that they have a right to dispose
of the lives, property, and future of others, that private ownership of
the means of production is a selfish evil, that the more a person has
achieved, the greater is his or her debt to those who have not achieved
it, that men and women can be compelled to go on producing under any
terms or conditions their rulers decree, that freedom is a luxury that
may have been permissible in a primitive economy, but for the running of
giant industries, electronic factories, and complex sciences, nothing
less than slave labor will do. Whether they propose to take over the
economy outright, in the manner of communists and socialists, or to
maintain the pretense of private property while dictating prices, wages,
production, and distribution, in the manner of fascists and welfare
statists, it is the gun, it is the rule of physical force that they
consider \"kind,\" they who consider the free market \"cruel.\" Since
the moral justification offered for the rule of force is humankind\'s
need of the things that persons of ability produce, it follows (in the
collectivist\'s system of thought) that the greater an individual\'s
productive ability, the greater are the penalties he or she must endure,
in the form of controls, regulations, expropriations. Consider, for
example, the principle of the progressive income tax: those who produce
the most are penalized accordingly; those who produce nothing receive a
subsidy, in the form of relief payments. Or consider the enthusiastic
advocacy of socialized medicine. What is the justification offered for
placing the practice of medicine under government control? The
importance of the services that physicians perform-the urgency of their
patients\' need. Physicians are to be penalized precisely because they
have so great a contribution to make to human welfare; thus is virtue
turned into a liability. In denying human beings freedom of thought and
action, statists and collectivist systems are anti-self-esteem by their
very nature. Self-confident, self-respecting men and women are unlikely
to accept the premise that they exist for the sake of others. A free
society cannot be maintained without an ethics of rational
self-interest. Neither can it be maintained except by men and women who
have achieved a healthy level of self-esteem. And a healthy level of
self-esteem cannot be maintained without a willingness to assert-and, if
necessary, fight for-our right to exist. It is on this point that issues
of psychology, ethics, and politics converge. If I may allow myself a
brief aside, one might imagine that psychologists, social scientists,
and philosophers who speak enthusiastically and reverently about
freedom, self-responsibility, autonomy, the beauty of self-regulating
systems, and the power of synergy (the behavior of whole systems
unpredicted by the behavior of the parts taken separately) would
naturally be champions of noncoercion. More often than not, as I have
already indicated, just the opposite is true. They tend to be among the
most vociferous in crying for the coercive apparatus of government to
further their particular ideals. To quote Waterman once again: It should
be recognized that a defining feature of a synergistic society is that
participation in it is voluntary. If people do not choose to engage in a
given cooperative activity, the implication is that they do not perceive
that activity to be helpful, either for themselves or for others.
Efforts to promote social cooperation within a synergistic society may
appropriately include such techniques as education, persuasion, and
negotiation. However, the use of political force to compel cooperation
represents the abandonment of the synergistic ideal. A free society
cannot automatically guarantee the mental or emotional well-being of all
its members. Freedom from external coercion is not a sufficient
condition of our optimal fulfillment, but it is a necessary one. The
great virtue of capitalism-laissez-faire capitalism, as contrasted not
only with the more extreme forms of statism but also with the mixed
economy we have today-is that it is the one system whose defining
principle is precisely this barring of physical coercion from human
relationships. No other political system pays even lip service to this
principle

A central occupation of economists is to analyze the nature, causes, and
effects of incentives --- the circumstances that are held to motivate
human action. [Economists agree on the positive role that \"good\"
incentives play to increase production. They also agree that
\"perverse\" incentives have an opposite impact. One of these perverse
incentives is called moral hazard]{.underline}, the subject of our
present essay. [Moral hazard is the incentive of a person A to use more
resources than he otherwise would have used, because he knows, or
believes he knows, that someone else B will provide some or all of these
resources. The important point is that this occurs **against B\'s will**
and that B is unable to sanction this expropriation immediately. The
mere incentive to rely on resources provided by others is not **per se**
problematic.]{.underline} For example, the announcement of a future
inheritance might prompt the prospective heir to spend more in the
present than he would otherwise have spent. In such cases we would not
speak of moral hazard. [A genuine moral-hazard problem appears however
if A has the possibility to use B\'s resources against B\'s will and if
he knows this. Laymen would call A\'s incentives a \"temptation to
steal\" or a \"temptation to act irresponsibly.\" Economists, ever weary
of moralizing, have espoused the technocratic expression \"moral
hazard.\"]{.underline} Thus the essential feature of moral hazard is
that it incites some people A to expropriate other people B. [The
B-people in turn, if they realize the presence of such a moral hazard,
have an incentive to react against this possible expropriation. They
make other choices than those that they would consider to be best if
there were no moral hazard. Many economists have therefore concluded
that **moral hazard entails market failures**; it brings about a
different allocation of resources than the one that would exist in the
absence of moral hazard. Conventional economic theory explains moral
hazard as a consequence of the fact that market participants are
unequally well informed about economic reality]{.underline}. In other
words, moral hazard results from \"asymmetries of information\" and the
theory of moral hazard is therefore considered to be a part of the
economics of information.

## Taking wealth forcefully kills charitable desires. {#taking-wealth-forcefully-kills-charitable-desires. .Tags}

Rothbard, economist, Austrian School, 04

(Murray Rothbard, economist, Austrian School, 04, Welfare and the Images
of Charity, p 465)

The mistake, they say, is to convert moral pressure into compulsion ---
to force people to do what everyone agrees it would be morally desirable
for them to do. Murray Rothbard's view is typical. He recognizes that
charity is a good thing, but writes, "\[I\]t makes all the difference in
the world whether the aid is given voluntarily or is stolen by force."
\[I\]t is hardly charity to take wealth by force and hand it over to
someone else. Indeed this is the direct opposite of charity, which can
only be an unbought, voluntary act of grace. Compulsory confiscation can
only deaden charitable desires completely, as the wealthier grumble that
there is no point in giving to charity when the state has already taken
on the task. This is another illustration of the truth that men can
become more moral only through rational persuasion, not through
violence, which will, in fact, have the opposite effect}

(Max More, founder of Extropy Institute, 1986, "THE IMPORTANCE OF
SELFISHNESS, THE DANGERS OF ALTRUISM,"
http://www.thedegree.org/philn004.pdf)

Finally, it would be fitting to consider the matter of competition in
the context of the pursuit of rational self-interest. Many people say
that capitalism is an entirely competitive economic system. They say
that competition, while it serves a number of useful purposes, breeds
hostility, violence, and unhappiness. The first assertion is false and
the second may or may not be true depending on how it is interpreted.
Objectivists are principled moral agents, not 'materialists' and can
therefore happily join in by condemning the "rat race". The first point
to note is that capitalism is both cooperative and competitive. Firms
compete within a market but firms also cooperate every time they buy and
sell raw materials, semi-finished goods, etc., from each other.
Individuals within a firm must cooperate to get their jobs done. Every
time anyone buys anything on the free market, cooperation is occurring;
both parties get together to make a mutually beneficial exchange. On the
other hand, in a socialist economy you are told what to produce and have
little or no choice as to what you consume. Where competition exists in
a free market it promotes progress and benefits everyone. In a socialist
system, competition is for positions of coercive power. Within a free
market --- or mixed economy such as ours --- more than one type of
competition is possible. One can compete in a friendly, relaxed way,
always bearing in mind one's values and rational self-interest. Or one
can madly, obsessively, irrationally compete for ends set by other
people --- whether 'society', the company, the government, or parents.
This second type of competition is truly a "rat race", a scrambling for
advancement where one's self-interest and values are lost sight of. It
is not competition between those pursuing their rational self-interest
that is bad. It is competition between those trying to fulfill their
irrational whims (perhaps for wealth or fame), or to conform to
standards set by others. It is common for people to wear themselves down
developing heart disease, ulcers, and hypertension, to become heavy
drinkers, insomniacs, or pillpoppers, with no regard for their
happiness. Capitalism does not demand this, and though it does not
prevent it (only force, with all its consequences, can do that), it does
function better without it. Studies have shown that most successful
managers in business are generally pleasant, non-compulsive individuals
who are a pleasure to work for. It is **altruism** which **promotes
overly strenuous** (and misguided) **effort since the individual does
not matter --- only the good of the company/government/ society/one's
parents matters**. The rationally self-interested person has a great
deal of self-esteem. The altruist lacks self-esteem. And it is lack of
self-esteem that leads to neurotic, inappropriately competitive
behaviour since the esteem of other people must be earned at all cost to
fill the gap. (See Branden's The Psychology of Self-Esteem for the
importance of this factor.) If one has no self-worth one must compete
hard to prove oneself to others. Rational people do not need to win,
since that implies that you can't be happy without defeating someone.
There is no need to win. To play the game of life according to one's
values, in pursuit of one's happiness, one's self-interest, is all that
matters.

## Capitalism solves war -- economic interdependencies {#capitalism-solves-war-economic-interdependencies .Tags}

Winter **2008**: Human Rights, Limited Government, and Capitalism.
http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj28n1/cj28n1-3.pdf

[Capitalist development contributes not only to prosperity but also to
reducing the risk of war]{.underline}. [From a human rights perspective,
the avoidance of war is a paramount concern because the fog of war has
frequently been used as a cover for human rights abuses and war
crimes]{.underline} (Apodaca 2001; Harrelson-Stephens and Callaway 2001;
Richards, Gelleny, and Sacko 2001).8 [Econometric studies]{.underline}
(Gartzke 2005, 2007; Russett and Oneal 2001; Weede 2005) [are compatible
with the following causal relationships between economic freedom,
prosperity, and peace]{.underline}: Whether assessed by financial market
openness, trade, or property rights, economic freedom contributes to
peace. [The more trade there is between two states or the more they are
economically interdependent, the less likely military conflict between
them becomes.]{.underline}

[In addition to this]{.underline} direct [effect of economic freedom on
the avoidance of war, there is an indirect effect via prosperity and
democracy]{.underline} that is well documented (Lipset 1994; Russett and
Oneal 2001; Weede 2005). [The freer an economy is, the more prosperous
it is likely to be. The more prosperous a country is, the more likely it
is to be a democracy.]{.underline}9 [Military conflict between
democracies is extremely unlikely. Economic freedom and free
trade]{.underline}---that is, the global expansion of capitalism [and
the corresponding catch-up opportunities for poor countries---constitute
the beginning of the causal chain leading to democracy and
peace]{.underline}, [at least to peace among prosperous or capitalist
democracies]{.underline}. [Economic freedom]{.underline} and free trade
also [exert a direct pacifying impact]{.underline}. Therefore, it is
preferable to call this set of pacifying conditions the "capitalist (or
market-liberal) peace" rather than the "democratic peace."

Erik **Gartzke** (Associate Professor of Political Science PhD,
University of Iowa) **2005**: Future Depends on Capitalizing on
Capitalist Peace

With terrorism achieving \"global reach\" and conflict raging in Africa
and the Middle East, you may have missed a startling fact - we are
living in remarkably peaceable times.

[For six decades, developed nations have not fought each
other]{.underline}. France and the United States may chafe, but the
resulting conflict pitted french fries against \"freedom fries,\" rather
than French soldiers against U.S. \"freedom fighters.\" Tony Blair and
Jacques Chirac had a nasty spat over the EU, but the English aren\'t
going to storm Calais any time soon.

[The present peace is unusual. Historically, powerful nations are the
most war prone. The conventional wisdom is that democracy fosters peace
but this claim fails scrutiny. It is based on statistical studies that
show democracies typically don\'t fight other democracies.]{.underline}

Yet, [the same studies show that democratic nations go to
war]{.underline} about [as much as other nations]{.underline} overall.
[And more recent research makes clear that only the affluent democracies
are less likely to fight each other. Poor democracies behave much like
non-democracies when it comes to war and lesser forms of
conflict.]{.underline}

[A more powerful explanation is emerging from newer]{.underline}, and
older, [empirical research - the \"capitalist peace]{.underline}.\" As
predicted by Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Norman Angell and others, [nations
with high levels of economic freedom not only fight each other less,
they go to war less often]{.underline}, period. [Economic freedom is a
measure of the depth of free market institutions or, put another way, of
capitalism.]{.underline}

[The \"democratic peace\" is a mirage created by the overlap between
economic and political freedom]{.underline}. Democracy and economic
freedom typically co-exist. Thus, if economic freedom causes peace, then
statistically democracy will also appear to cause peace.

[When democracy and economic freedom are both included in a statistical
model, the results reveal that economic freedom]{.underline} is
considerably more potent in encouraging peace than democracy, [50 times
more potent]{.underline}, in fact, according to my own research.
Economic freedom is highly statistically significant (at the
one-per-cent level). [Democracy does not have a measurable impact, while
nations with very low levels of economic freedom are 14 times more prone
to conflict than those with very high levels]{.underline}.

But, [why would free markets cause peace?]{.underline} [Capitalism is
not only an immense generator of prosperity; it is also a revolutionary
source of economic, social and political change. Wealth no longer arises
primarily through land or control of natural resources]{.underline}.

MORALITY VS. EFFICIENCY.
http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj15n2-3-3.html

Conclusion

[The struggle to extend and preserve free markets must have as its
primary focus the moral argument. State interventionists stand naked
before well-thought-out moral arguments for private ownership of
property, voluntary exchange, and the parity of markets. People readily
understand moral arguments on a private basis]{.underline}\--for
example, [one person does not have the right to use force against
another to serve his own purposes. However, people often see government
redistribution as an acceptable use of force]{.underline}. [In a
democratic welfare state that coercion is given an aura of
legitimacy.]{.underline} The challenge is to convince people that a
majority vote does not establish morality and that [free markets are
morally superior to other forms of human organization]{.underline}.

James A. **Dorn** (vice president for academic affairs at the Cato
Institute and professor of economics at Towson University in

Maryland) **2005**: Why Freedom Matters.
http://www.cato.org/pubs/wtpapers/dorn-080105.pdf

[The future of civilization depends on preserving and spreading
freedom]{.underline}. [As a moral principle, freedom means we ought to
respect private property rights, broadly understood as the rights to
life, liberty, and property. As a practical matter, when private
property rights are protected by law, individuals will be free to trade
for mutual gain and be held responsible for their behavior.]{.underline}
Social and economic coordination---or what F. A. Hayek called
"spontaneous order"---emerges from the voluntary decisions of millions
of free people under limited government and the rule of law. Those
nations that have failed to adopt freedom as a first principle have also
failed to realize the benefits of freedom. They have ignored the great
liberal idea, as articulated in *The Law* by Frédéric Bastiat in the
mid-nineteenth century, that "[the solution of the social problem lies
in liberty." By "social problem" Bastiat meant the problem of
coordination that confronts every society---that is, the problem of
satisfying people's wants for goods and services without central
planning. The beauty of the market system, based on private property
rights and freedom of contract, is that it allows individuals to
continuously adjust to new information about wants, resources, and
technology, and to engage in mutually beneficial exchanges]{.underline}.
[Economic freedom increases the range of choices and thus the wealth of
nations. Those countries with greater economic freedom have higher
standards of living than those with less freedom]{.underline} (figure
1). Moreover, countries that have liberalized more quickly---as measured
by the index of economic freedom---have tended to grow faster than
countries that have failed to liberalize or that have liberalized more
slowly (figure 2). [Economists]{.underline} James Gwartney and Robert
Lawson, the authors of the Fraser Institute's annual *Economic Freedom
of the World*, [find that "long term differences in economic freedom
explain approximately two-thirds of the variation in cross-country per
capita GDP." It is no secret that countries that have opened to the
forces of international trade and have restrained the growth of
government have prospered, while those countries that have limited the
scope of the market have stagnated.]{.underline} Hong Kong's consistent
adherence to market-liberal principles has resulted in long-run
prosperity and the world's freest economy since 1970. In its *2005 Index
of Economic Freedom*, the Heritage Foundation and the *Wall Street
Journal* once again ranked Hong Kong number one. On hearing the good
news, Financial Secretary Henry Tang remarked,"I am pleased virtues we
have been upholding to keep Hong Kong flourishing as a free market
economy have once again been reaffirmed by the international community."
Those virtues include [credibility and reliability]{.underline},
prudence and thrift, entrepreneurial alertness, personal responsibility,
[respect for others, and tolerance]{.underline}. They [are fostered by
private property rights, the rule of law, freedom of contract, open
trade, low tax rates, and limited government]{.underline}. Nations that
have not followed the virtues of Hong Kong have not reaped the long-run
benefits of economic freedom. North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, Iraq, and Haiti
are but a few examples. The lesson is that [the virtues of the market
require constant practice if they are to survive and flourish.
Government policy must be market-friendly and transparent; it cannot be
muddled. Markets discount future effects of current policy changes. If
those changes are in the direction of greater economic freedom, they
will be immediately rewarded and wealth created]{.underline}. Illiberal
trade policies, higher tax rates, increased government spending, erratic
monetary policy, and wage-price controls undermine private property
rights, send negative signals to the global capital markets, and destroy
the wealth of nations. The failure of central planning in the Soviet
Union and China has moved those countries in the direction of greater
economic freedom, but the ghost of communism still haunts Russia, while
the Chinese Communist Party has yet to abandon its monopoly on power.
Leaders of emerging market economies need to recognize that [economic
freedom is an important component of personal freedom, that free-market
prices and profits provide useful information and incentives to allocate
resources to where *consumers* (not politicians or planners) deem them
most valuable, and that markets extend the range of choice and increase
human welfare]{.underline}. Most important, [leaders must understand
that ultimately economic liberalization requires limited government and
constitutionally protected rights]{.underline}. Emerging market
economies, especially in Asia, have discovered the magic of the market;
they have also found that chaos emerges when the institutional
infrastructure necessary for free markets is weakened by excessive
government. When politics trumps markets, coercion and corruption
follow. **The Ethical Basis** [the ethical basis of the market system is
often overlooked]{.underline}, but not by those like Zhang
[Shuguang]{.underline}, an economist at the Unirule Institute in
Beijing, who were deprived of their economic liberties under central
planning. He [compares the coercive nature of planning with the
voluntary nature of the market and concludes: "In the market system . .
. the fundamental logic is free choice and equal status of individuals.
The corresponding ethics . . . is mutual respect]{.underline}, mutual
benefit, and mutual credit."1 [The moral justification for individual
freedom is selfevident]{.underline}. In *Ethics for the New Millennium*,
the Dalai Lama wrote:"[We all desire happiness and wish to avoid
suffering]{.underline}. . . . [Ethical conduct is not something we
engage in because it is somehow right in itself but because, like
ourselves, all others desire to be happy and to avoid
suffering.]{.underline} Given that this is a natural disposition, shared
by all, it follows that each individual has a right to pursue this
goal." Freedom without rules is an illusion. The famous Zen master
Shunryu Suzuki wrote in his classic text, *Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind*:
"People, especially young people, think that freedom is to do just what
they want. . . . But it is absolutely necessary . . . to have some
rules. . . . As long as you have rules, you have a chance for freedom."
[The rules necessary for a market-liberal order are rules to protect the
private sphere so individuals can pursue their self-interest while
respecting the equal rights of others]{.underline}. Without clear rules
to limit the use of force to the protection of persons and property,
freedom and justice will suffer---and economic development, properly
understood, will cease. In 1740 the great liberal David Hume wrote that
"the peace and security of human society entirely depend \[on adherence
to\] the three fundamental laws of nature, *that of the stability of
possession, of its transference by consent,* and *of the performance of
promises*" (*A Treatise of Human Nature*). His legacy of liberty should
not be forgotten. **Development and Freedom** in *Economic Analysis and
Policy in Underdeveloped Countries*, the late Peter (Lord) Bauer argued
that [economic development and freedom are inseparable:]{.underline} "I
regard the extension of [the range of choice]{.underline}, that is, an
increase in the range of effective alternatives open to people, [as the
principal objective and criterion of economic development]{.underline}."
[Economists have found that countries with secure private property
rights create more wealth]{.underline} (as measured by real GDP per
capita) than countries in which property is not protected by law. [Trade
liberalization is vital to the process of development. Voluntary
international exchange widens consumers' range of effective choices and
lowers the risk of conflict]{.underline}. There is a saying in China:
"*Wu wei ze wu shu bu wei*"---"[If no unnatural control, then there is
nothing you cannot do]{.underline}." In the *Tao Te Ching*, Lao Tzu
advocates the principle of nonintervention (*wu wei*) as the ideal way
of ruling. [The wise ruler says,"I take no action and the people of
themselves are transformed. I engage in no activity and the people of
themselves become prosperous." 2 To take no action does not mean to do
nothing, but rather]{.underline}, as Chinese scholar Derk Bodde has
noted, [to refrain from those actions that are "forced, artificial, and
unspontaneous."3 A natural order is one consistent with free markets and
free people]{.underline}; it is Adam Smith's "simple system of natural
liberty."As former Czech President Václav Havel so elegantly stated
after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the free-market economy is "the
only natural economy, the only kind that makes sense, the only one that
can lead to prosperity, because it is the only one that reflects the
nature of life itself."4 Leaders in the West as well as the East should
keep the following five lessons in the forefront of their minds as they
contemplate future policy decisions: (1) [private property, freedom, and
justice are inseparable]{.underline}; (2) justice requires limiting
government to the protection of persons and property; (3) [minimizing
the use of force to defend life, liberty, and property will maximize
freedom and create a spontaneous market-liberal order]{.underline}; (4)
[private free markets are not only moral, they create wealth by
providing incentives to discover new ways of doing things and increase
the range of alternatives; and]{.underline} (5) [governments rule best
when they follow the rule of law and the principle of
noninterference]{.underline}.

Now for the overview. The principle conclusion emerging from previous
work on the causes of war and this project is that [power kills,
absolute power kills absolutely. The more power a government has, the
more it can act arbitrarily according to the whims and desires of the
elite, the more it will make war on others and murder its foreign and
domestic subjects. The more constrained the power of governments, the
more it is diffused, checked and balanced, the less it will aggress on
others and commit
democide]{.underline}.[^8^](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.ART.HTM#8)
At the extremes of power, [totalitarian communist governments murder
their people by the tens of *millions*]{.underline}, while many
democracies can barely bring themselves to execute even serial
murderers. As listed in [Table
1](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.TAB1.GIF) , [this century\'s
*megamurderers*\--those states killing in cold blood]{.underline}, aside
from warfare, 1,000,000 or more men, women, and children\--have murdered
over 151,000,000 people, [almost four times the almost 38,500,000
battle-dead for all this century\'s international and civil
wars]{.underline} up to 1987. [The most absolute Power, that is the
communist U.S.S.R., China and preceding Mao guerrillas, Khmer Rouge
Cambodia, Vietnam, and Yugoslavia, as well as Nazi Germany, account for
near 128,000,000 of them, or 84 percent]{.underline}. No one of the
remaining megamurderers, which include the regimes of
Pakistan,[^9^](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.ART.HTM#9) wartime
Japan, Nationalist China, Cambodia, communist Vietnam, post-War II
Poland,[^10^](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.ART.HTM#10) and
communist Yugoslavia, were democratic when it committed its democide.
Then there are the kilomurderers, or those states that have killed
innocents by the tens or hundreds of thousands, the top five of which
were the China Warlords (1917-1949), Atatürk\'s Turkey (1919-1923), the
United Kingdom (primarily due to the 1914-1919 food blockade of the
Central Powers and Levant in and after World War I, and the 1940-45
indiscriminate bombing of German cities), Portugal (1926-1982), and
Indonesia (1965-87). These are shown in [Table
1](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.TAB1.GIF). Some lesser
kilomurderers were communist Afghanistan, Angola, Albania, Rumania, and
Ethiopia, as well as authoritarian Hungary, Burundi, Croatia (1941-44),
Czechoslovakia (1945-46), Indonesia, Iraq, the Czar\'s Russia, and
Uganda. For its indiscriminate bombing of German and Japanese civilians,
the United States must also be included on this list. These and other
kilomurderers add almost 15,000,000 people killed to the democide for
this century. As listed in [Table
2](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.TAB2.GIF), [the most lethal
regime in this century was that of the communist Khmer Rouge in Cambodia
during 1975 through 1978. In less than four years of governing they
exterminated over 31 percent of their men, women, and
children]{.underline}; the odds of any Cambodian surviving these four
long years was only about 2.2 to 1. As mentioned, the
[Appendix](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.APP.GIF) exemplifies
some of the estimates of this killing. The major and better known
episodes and institutions for which these and other regimes were
responsible are listed in [Table
3](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.TAB3.GIF). [Far above all is
gulag\--the Soviet slave-labor system created by Lenin and built up
under Stalin. In some 70 years it likely chewed up almost 40,000,000
lives, over *twice* as many as probably died in some 400 years of the
African slave trade, from capture to sale in an Arab, Oriental, or New
World market.]{.underline} [In total, during the first eighty-eight
years of this century, almost 170,000,000 men, women, and children have
been shot, beaten, tortured, knifed, burned, starved, frozen, crushed,
or worked to death; or buried alive, drowned, hanged, bombed, or killed
in any other of the myriad ways governments have inflicted death on
unarmed, helpless citizens or foreigners. The dead even could
conceivable be near a high of 360,000,000 people. This is as though our
species has been devastated by a modern Black Plague. And indeed it has,
but a plague of absolute power and not germs. Adding the human cost of
war to this democide total, governments have violently killed over
203,000,000 people in this century]{.underline}. [Table
4](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.TAB4.GIF) breaks down this
toll by type of regime. [Figure
1](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.FIG1.GIF) graphs the regime
comparisons. Now, [democracies themselves are responsible for some of
the democide. Almost all of this is foreign democide during war, and
mainly those enemy civilians killed in indiscriminate urban bombing, as
of Germany and Japan in World War II]{.underline}. [It also includes the
large scale massacres of Filipinos during the bloody American
colonization of the Philippines]{.underline} at the beginning of this
century, deaths in British concentration camps in South Africa during
the Boar War, civilian deaths due to starvation during the
aforementioned British blockade, the rape and murder of helpless Chinese
in and around Peking in 1900, the atrocities committed by Americans in
Vietnam, the murder of helpless Algerians during the Algerian War by the
French, and the unnatural deaths of German prisoners of war in French
and American POW camps after World War II. [All this killing of
foreigners by democracies may seem to violate the principle that power
kills, absolute power kills absolutely, but really underlines it. For in
each case, the killing was carried out in secret, behind a conscious
cover of lies and deceit by those agencies and power-holders involved.
All were shielded by tight censorship of the press and control of
journalists.]{.underline} Even the indiscriminate bombing of German
cities by the British was disguised before the House of Commons and in
press releases as attacks on German military targets. That the general
strategic bombing policy was to attack working men\'s homes was kept
secret still long after the war. And finally, [Figure
2](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.FIG2.GIF) (one of the most
important comparisons on democide and power produced by this project)
displays the range of democide estimates for each regime, that is, level
of power. As mentioned over 8,100 estimates of democide from over a
thousand sources were collected to arrive at a most likely low and high
for democide committed by 219 regimes or groups. The totals that have
been displayed in previous figures have been the sum of conservatively
determined mid-totals in this range. [Figure
2](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.FIG2.GIF) then presents for
each type of regime, such as the authoritarian, this range resulting
from the sum of all the lows and highs for all the democide of all
regimes of that type. The difference between the three resulting ranges
drawn in the figure can only be understood in terms of
power.[^11^](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/POWER.ART.HTM#11) As the
arbitrary power of regimes increase left to right in the figure, the
range of their democide jumps accordingly and to such a great extent
that the low democide for the authoritarian regime is *above* the
democratic high, and the authoritarian high is *below* the totalitarian
low. [The empirical and theoretical conclusion from these and other
results is clear. The way to virtually eliminate genocide and mass
murder appears to be through restricting and checking power. This means
to *foster democratic freedom*. This is the ultimate
conclusion]{.underline} of this project.

First, government inefficiencies might become large enough that even
with somewhat higher quality, the cost of allowing government management
offsets the benefits. As Stiglitz (1989) has noted, \`public
management\' is itself a public good, and one that is often hard for
voters to observe easily. Wolf (1988) reviews a large number of studies
on the comparative efficiency of the public and private sector, noting
that most \-- but by no means all \-- of them conclude the private
sector is able to operate at lower (in some cases very much lower)
costs.\[6\] Few of these studies focus on social service areas, however.
Poterba (1996) notes that it is not clear that the government is
markedly less efficient in comparison to the non-profit sector, which
provides the primary private-sector alternative to the public sector in
many areas of social services in the United States.

Second, the more that government is plagued by patronage and corruption
problems, the less attractive is the government management of services.
Such problems may be one particular reason why the government is less
efficient, but they are likely to also affect the quality of services
provided, as well as the extent to which the government meets public
goals about access and equity in the provision of services. Of course,
it is worth noting that corruption in the public sector in many
countries often mirrors corruption in the private sector. In this
situation, it is unclear which sector is the preferred provider of
services.

Third, the government may be ineffective in providing higher quality
services. Poor management and inefficiencies in the public sector may be
causally related to low quality services, in which case the
price/quality tradeoff posited above is an inaccurate characterisation;
lower prices and higher quality may be complements rather than
substitutes. Indeed, in cases where the public sector underpays workers
relative to the market, or provides particularly bad managerial
oversight, the quality of government-provided services may be very low.
(There are plenty of examples of this in my current hometown of
Washington, D.C.) The lower the quality of publicly-provided services,
the less apparent force there is to the argument that the private sector
will provide services at too low a quality level. As Wolf (1988) has
noted, there is extensive \`nonmarket failure\' in government, just as
there may be market failure in the private sector.

(Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Prof. Emeritus of Econ, University of Nevada,
04/1993, "A Four-Step Health-Care Solution," *Mises Institute,*
<http://mises.org/freemarket_detail.aspx?control=279>)

It\'s true that the U.S. health care system is a mess, but this
demonstrates not market but government failure. To cure the problem
requires not different or more government regulations and bureaucracies,
as self-serving politicians want us to believe, but the elimination of
all existing government controls. It\'s time to get serious about health
care reform. Tax credits, vouchers, and privatization will go a long way
toward decentralizing the system and removmg unnecessary burdens from
business. But four additional steps must also be taken: 1. Eliminate all
licensing requirements for medical schools, hospitals, pharmacies, and
medical doctors and other health care personnel. Their supply would
almost instantly increase, prices would fall, and a greater variety of
health care services would appear on the market. Competing voluntary
accreditation agencies would take the place of compulsory government
licensing\--if health care providers believe that such accreditation
would enhance their own reputation, and that their consumers care about
reputation, and are willing to pay for it. Because consumers would no
longer be duped into believing that there is such a thing as a
\"national standard\" of health care, they will increase their search
costs and make more discriminating health care choices. 2. Eliminate all
government restrictions on the production and sale of pharmaceutical
products and medical devices. This means no more Food and Drug
Administration, which presently hinders innovation and increases costs.
Costs and prices would fall, and a wider variety of better products
would reach the market sooner. The market would force consumers to act
in accordance with their own\--rather than the government\'s\--risk
assessment. And competing drug and device manufacturers and sellers, to
safeguard against product liability suits as much as to attract
customers, would provide increasingly better product descriptions and
guarantees. 3. Deregulate the health insurance industry. Private
enterprise can offer insurance against events over whose outcome the
insured possesses no control. One cannot insure oneself against suicide
or bankruptcy, for example, because it is in one\'s own hands to bring
these events about. Because a person\'s health, or lack of it, lies
increasingly within his own control, many, if not most health risks, are
actually uninsurable. \"Insurance\" against risks whose likelihood an
individual can systematically influence falls within that person\'s own
responsibility. All insurance, moreover, involves the pooling of
individual risks. It implies that insurers pay more to some and less to
others. But no one knows in advance, and with certainty, who the
\"winners\" and \"losers\" will be. \"Winners\" and \"losers\" are
distributed randomly, and the resulting income redistribution is
unsystematic. If \"winners\" or \"losers\" could be systematically
predicted, \"losers\" would not want to pool their risk with
\"winners,\" but with other \"losers,\" because this would lower their
insurance costs. I would not want to pool my personal accident risks
with those of professional football players, for instance, but
exclusively with those of people in circumstances similar to my own, at
lower costs. Because of legal restrictions on the health insurers\'
right of refusal\--to exclude any individual risk as uninsurable\--the
present health-insurance system is only partly concerned with insurance.
The industry cannot discriminate freely among different groups\' risks.
As a result, health insurers cover a multitude of uninnsurable risks,
alongside, and pooled with, genuine insurance risks. They do not
discriminate among various groups of people which pose significantly
different insurance risks. The industry thus runs a system of income
redistribution\--benefiting irresponsible actors and high-risk groups at
the expense of responsible individuals and low risk groups. Accordingly
the industry\'s prices are high and ballooning. To deregulate the
industry means to restore it to unrestricted freedom of contract: to
allow a health insurer to offer any contract whatsoever, to include or
exclude any risk, and to discriminate among any groups of individuals.
Uninsurable risks would lose coverage, the variety of insurance policies
for the remaining coverage would increase, and price differentials would
reflect genuine insurance risks. On average, prices would drastically
fall. And the reform would restore individual responsibility in health
care. 4. Eliminate all subsidies to the sick or unhealthy. Subsidies
create more of whatever is being subsidized. Subsidies for the ill and
diseased breed illness and disease, and promote carelessness, indigence,
and dependency. If we eliminate them, we would strengthen the will to
live healthy lives and to work for a living. In the first instance, that
means abolishing Medicare and Medicaid. Only these four steps, although
drastic, will restore a fully free market in medical provision. Until
they are adopted, the industry will have serious problems, and so will
we, its consumers.

History shows that it is only through private voluntary solutions that
we see true human compassion. Organizations and individuals, in the
spirit of compassion, provided poverty relief that embraced generosity,
but recognized the dire consequences of haphazardly given aid. Most
social workers of a century ago understood that good character,
self-reliance, and strong social ties were virtues that must be
instilled in the poor if there were to be any gains made in alleviating
poverty. Before the Depression private solutions played an important
moral and material role for the poor. Whereas government relies on
coercion, charities and fraternal societies embody the qualities that
make volunteerism socially advantageous. Conversely, the past 70 years
have shown that government has not prudently handled, and cannot
prudently handle, the plight of the poor. Rather than help those in need
of assistance during times of trouble, the federal government has
imprisoned them in a political power game, resulting in increased
dependence. **Only abolition of the government dole will allow the
private sector to once again achieve the levels of social welfare seen
in the past**.

According to the results of this experiment, uncertainty and tax rates
significantly influence both the rate of voluntary contributions and the
crowding out effect. **Subjects voluntarily contributed a higher
percentage of income when the tax rate was low** and subjects were
uncertain as to whether they would be disadvantaged. This leads one to
conjecture that low income individuals with less education and skills
may be more inclined to voluntarily contribute to income support and
social programs because their probability of needing such support is
higher. High income, two wage earning families are less likely to ever
need welfare, food stamps, etc. and, consequently, are less inclined to
voluntarily contribute to such programs. If this is the case, then
taxation to compel the contribution of higher income individuals may
well increase the supply of income support and social programs. This
study points to progressive taxation as a means of maintaining or
increasing the supply of social programs. With respect to crowding out,
**97 percent of contributions were crowded out when tax rates were
increased from 0 to l0 percent**.

**Rothschild**, University of Linz, Vienna, Austria, **03**

(Kurt Rothschild, University of Linz, Vienna, Austria, 2003, Reflections
on an anniversary: Friedman\'s Capitalism and Freedom, Journal of
Economic Studies, Volume 30, Number 5, pp. 548-557(10), IngentaConnect)
jz

The usual distinction between "negative" and "positive" freedom is that
the first demands that individuals should not be interfered with when
carrying out their desired actions (which in turn must not interfere
with the plans of other people), while "positive" freedom is concerned
with the question to what degree individuals are given the opportunity
to choose between different actions. Nothing speaks against adopting
one\'s personal preference as a concept of "Freedom" which includes both
aspects, the positive and the negative one. Amartya Sen or John Rawls
are the outstanding examples of social scientists adopting such a view.
But this wider perspective leads to a more complicated situation when it
comes to practical applications of one\'s "philosophy". While policies
and institutions -- in both politics and economics -- may very well
foster at the same time both positive and negative freedoms, there are
also frequent cases where the two come into conflict. Then, difficult
problems of trade-offs can arise\[2\]: How much can be taken away from
some people (e.g. through taxes) reducing the degree of their (negative)
freedom, in order to increase the degree of (positive) freedom of some
other people (e.g. through subsidies). Friedman gets rid of such
difficult choices in his abstract and practical deliberations by making
negative freedom a dominant and sole target. He draws a sharp division
"between equality of rights and equality of opportunity, on the one
hand, and material equality or equality of outcome on the other" (p.
195). While he accepts the first target, he rejects the second because
it might come into conflict with the first. This confrontation of the
two supposedly contradictory alternatives has two decisive flaws. First,
equality need not (and cannot in practice) be a question of complete
equality, but only of degrees of equality which makes it unnecessary to
draw a sharp either-or line, and second, the two alternatives are not
completely independent of each other. In particular, equality of
opportunity is not independent of the degree of equality or inequality
of material means. Friedman, however, insists that the first alternative
has to be the dominant principle of a "free" society. This does not mean
that he does not care about social and other societal problems. He does.
But in his view **they should as far as possible be left to voluntary
private activities with state interference kept at a minimum, because
coercion is abhorred**. "I find it hard, as a liberal, to see any
justification for graduated taxation solely to redistribute income. This
seems a clear case of using coercion to take from some in order to give
to others and thus to conflict head-on with individual freedom" (p.
174). **Added to this rejection of coercion is Friedman\'s belief that
the undisturbed free market with its efficiency can contribute to an
alleviation of social problems. Government motives and actions are
regarded with doubt and distrust**. This brings problems connected with
Friedman\'s approaches to capitalism and government. Freedom -- both in
its wider and narrower (Friedman-type) sense -- can be divided into
political and economic freedom. In both cases, the problem is -- for
Friedman the only one -- that power-based coercion can force people to
act differently from what they really want to do. In the political
field, this raises the question: how far the state should be allowed to
interfere into private decisions. This will be dealt with later. But
political freedom is also connected with economic freedom, which deals
with freedom for transactions in the economic sphere. For Friedman, with
his stress on negative freedom and his scepticism about government
power, which would be enhanced by controlling economic affairs, economic
freedom achieves priority. "Freedom in economic arrangements ... is an
end in itself ... and is also an indispensable means toward the
achievement of political freedom" (p. 8, italics added).

**Medearis**, Department of Political Science, University of California,

(John Medearis, Department of Political Science, University of
California, Riverside, 2005, Social Movements and Deliberative
Democratic Theory, British Journal of Political Science, 35 : 53-75
Cambridge University Press)

I adopt a view of coercion rooted in the current conceptualization of
deliberation itself. Indeed, before offering a definition, it is worth
exploring the close connection between non-coercion and deliberation.
One of the deliberative theorists' basic premises is that only those
decisions are legitimate that are -- or could be -- supported by
citizens for reasons they have reflected upon and think are good ones.
Coercion, simply as it is conventionally understood -- as compelling
through force or threats -- stands in obvious contrast to such a notion
of deliberation. For coercion, in this quite ordinary sense, would
bypass the attempt to gain reasoned support. This is surely why Dryzek
contrasts 'coercion' with 'persuasion' and contends that deliberative
democratic theory in general (not just his variety) rejects
'coercion'.11 A principled rejection of coercion runs deep in the
writings of Habermas and Rawls, who have not only endorsed deliberative
democracy, but, more importantly, provided much of its intellectual
apparatus. In a frequently-cited formulation, Habermas writes that
'participants in argumentation cannot avoid the presupposition that
...the structure of their communication rules out all external or
internal coercion other than the force of the better argument and
thereby also neutralizes all motives other than that of the cooperative
search for truth.'12 Such a co-operative search for truth, or 'action
oriented to reaching understanding', is the principled heart of at least
one major strand of deliberation.13 A similar understanding of coercion
is clearly also embedded in Rawls's central insistence that parties to
deliberation offer each other reasons and forms of co-operation that
they can accept, as he puts it, 'for the right reasons' -- and not
merely because of a 'balance of political and social forces' or
'sanctions'.14 Likewise, a number of central features of Gutmann and
Thompson's influential deliberative writings would seem to rule out
coercion: their Rawlsian commitment to 'reciprocity', one of three
putative deliberative values, which involves a sole reliance on 'reasons
that are shared or could come to be shared'; their stringent demand that
people who disagree 'continue to reason together to reach mutually
acceptable decisions'; and their disapproval of outcomes that turn,
strategically, on actors' self-interests.15 Bohman, similarly, makes the
exposing of coercion one of the three conditions of deliberative
legitimacy in pluralistic societies.16 Of course, deliberative democrats
do not claim that politics can be entirely non-coercive, any more than
they claim politics can be entirely deliberative. But they do claim that
decisions are democratically legitimate only in so far as they are
deliberative. And thus from their perspective, decisions are
democratically legitimate only in so far as the processes from which
they result are non-coercive.

In the realm of politics, we recognize that in order to take
life-promoting action, a person must be free to do so; he must be free
to act on the judgment of his mind, his basic means of living. The only
thing that can stop him from doing so is other people, and the only way
they can stop him is by means of physical force. Thus, in order to live
peacefully together in a society---in order to live together as
civilized beings, rather than as barbarians---people must refrain from
using physical force against one another. This fact gives rise to the
principle of individual rights, which is the principle of egoism applied
to politics. The principle of individual rights is the recognition of
the fact that each person is morally an end in himself, not a means to
the ends of others; therefore, he morally must be left free to act on
his own judgment for his own sake, so long as he does not violate that
same right of others. This principle is not a matter of personal opinion
or social convention or "divine revelation"; **it is a matter of the
factual requirements of human life in a social context**. A moral
society---a civilized society---is one in which the initiation of
physical force against human beings is prohibited by law. And the only
social system in which such force is so prohibited---consistently and on
principle---is pure, laissez-faire capitalism. Capitalism---which,
contrary to widespread mis-education, is not merely an economic
system---is the social system of individual rights, including property
rights, protected by a strictly limited government. In a laissez-faire
society, if people want to deal with one another, they may do so only on
voluntary terms, **by uncoerced agreement**. If they want to receive
goods or services from others, they may offer to exchange value for
value to mutual benefit; however, they may not seek to gain any value
from others by means of physical force. People are fully free to act on
their own judgment and thus to produce, keep, use, and dispose of their
own property as they see fit; the only thing they are not "free" to do
is to violate the rights of others. In a capitalist society, individual
rights cannot legally be violated by anyone---including the government.

http://www.nassauinstitute.org/articles/article636.php?view=print)

The real political task, however, is not to try to attract votes or
nudge policy in the context of the existing bell curve of voter
preferences. Rather, it is to move the curve in the direction of
individual freedom, limited constitutional government, and a truly free
market. In other words, the task is to shift the curve\'s dome over to
where its individualist tail end is today, so that someday the middle
mass of voters will more or less hold views generally consistent with
classical-liberal ideas. But this requires looking beyond what is
politically expedient today. Indeed, **it requires ignoring what seem to
be the boundaries of the politically possible and instead thinking in
terms of the politically desirable**. If policies really consistent with
individual freedom are ever to be implemented, we must first explain to
our fellow citizens what such a society of freedom would look like, how
it would work, and why it is desirable. They must slowly but surely come
to see the vision of liberty. Maybe part of the reason so many people
seem unable or unwilling to think beyond five minutes is that they are
so infrequently challenged to do. Maybe our fellow citizens find it
**hard to break out of the current mindset of the existing
interventionist welfare state because they are too rarely offered a
clear and consistent case** for the classical-liberal ideal and why it
would be good for them and others they care about. Maybe people are
often trapped in the policies of the short run precisely because they
almost never are presented with a political and economic philosophy of
freedom for the long run. Politics will always only reflect the existing
distribution of people\'s political views. Political campaigns,
therefore, will never be the primary method for transforming society
from less free to more free. This will only happen outside of the narrow
political process-through a change in the climate of ideas. Though most
people don\'t know it, they are guided by an implicit set of political
and economic principles when they think about and decide on what they
want government to do. These principles are the ideological residues of
nineteenth- and twentieth-century collectivism. **They need to be
replaced with a new set of political and economic principles, those of
classical liberalism. When a sufficient number of our fellow citizens
accept classical liberalism, politics will follow principle and the
interventionist welfare state will be opposed and finally abolished.**
This is why a radical change in principles must come before any
successful change in politics.

Demystification of the State

A. V. Dicey (1914: 257) wrote:

[The beneficial effect of State intervention]{.underline}, especially in
the form of legislation, [is]{.underline} direct, immediate, and so to
speak [visible, whilst its evil effects are gradual and indirect, and
lie outside our sight]{.underline}\.... Hence [the majority of mankind
must]{.underline} almost of necessity [look with undue favour upon
government intervention]{.underline}. This natural bias can be
counteracted only by the existence, in a given society, \... of a
presumption or prejudice in favour of individual liberty, that is of
laissez-faire.

[One can hardly determine the casualties of war simply by looking at
survivors]{.underline}. [We must ask what happened to those whom we do
not see.]{.underline} Similarly, when evaluating interventionist public
policy we cannot evaluate it simply by looking at its beneficiaries. We
must discover its victims. [Most often the victims of public policy are
invisible]{.underline}. [To garner greater public support against
government command and control, we must somehow find a way to make those
victims visible]{.underline}.

In all interventionist policy there are those who are beneficiaries and
those who are victims. In most cases the beneficiaries are highly
visible and the victims are invisible. [A good example is the minimum
wage law. After enactment of an increase in the minimum wage law,
politicians accompanied by television crews readily point to people who
have benefitted from the legislation]{.underline}. The beneficiaries are
those with a fatter paycheck. [Thus, the politician can lay claim to the
wisdom of his legislation that increased minimum wages. Moreover, the
politician is also a beneficiary since those now earning higher wages
will remember him when election time comes around]{.underline}. By
parading minimum wage beneficiaries across the stage, those who oppose
minimum wage increases can be readily portrayed as having a callous,
mean-spirited disregard for interests of low-wage workers.

[A political strategy of those who support liberty should be that of
exposing the invisible victims of minimum wage laws. We need to show
those who have lost their jobs, or do not become employed in the first
place, because their productivity did not warrant being employed at the
minimum wage. We should find a way to demonstrate jobs destroyed by
minimum wages such as busboys, gasoline station attendants, and movie
ushers]{.underline}. We must show how marginally profitable firms have
been forced out of business, though surviving firms may have the same
number of employees. [We should show how capital was artificially
substituted for labor as a result of higher mandated wages and how firms
have adjusted their production techniques in order to economize on
labor]{.underline}. The particular adjustments firms make in response to
higher mandated wages are less important than the fact that adjustments
will be made.

[A more dramatic example of the invisible victims of interventionist
state policy can be found in the regulation of medicines and medical
devices]{.underline}, as in the case of the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in the United States. Essentially, [FDA officials can make two
types of errors. They can err on the side of undercaution and approve a
drug with dangerous unanticipated side effects. Or they can err on the
side of overcaution, not approving a useful and safe drug, or creating
costly and lengthy drug approval procedures]{.underline}.

[Errors on the side of undercaution]{.underline} lead to embarrassment
and possibly loss of bureaucratic careers and promotions because the
victims of unsafe drugs [will be visible through news stories of sick
people]{.underline}, congressional investigations, and hearings.
[However, errors on the side of overcaution,]{.underline} through
extensive delay in the approval of drugs\--as in the cases of
propranolol, Septra, and other drugs\--[impose virtually no costs on the
FDA. Victims of FDA errors on the side of overcaution are]{.underline}
mostly [invisible]{.underline} to the press, the public, and
politicians.

Those victims should be made visible. [Once the FDA]{.underline} (or
some other approving agency) [approves a drug widely used elsewhere with
no untoward effects, we should find people who died or needlessly
suffered as a result of the FDA\'s delay]{.underline}. For political
efficiency we cannot simply offer intellectual arguments. We must get
pictures and stories of FDA victims in an effort to appeal to a sense of
fair play, decency, and common sense among the citizenry. But there is
also a role for intellectual arguments in the sense of teaching people
that any meaningful use of \"safe\'\' must see safety as a set of
tradeoffs rather than a category. [The attempt to get a \"safe\'\' drug
means that people will die or needlessly suffer during the time it takes
to achieve greater safety. That toll must be weighted against the number
of people who might die or become ill because of the drug\'s earlier
availability and attendant unanticipated harmful side
effects]{.underline}. [People should also be taught to understand that
if a 100 percent safe drug is ever achieved, it will be the only thing
in this world that is 100 percent safe]{.underline}.

A new Washington Post-ABC News poll again shows that voters prefer
"smaller government with fewer services" to "larger government with more
services":Obama has used the power and financial resources of the
federal government repeatedly as he has dealt with the country's
problems this year, to the consternation of his Republican critics. The
poll found little change in underlying public attitudes toward
government since the inauguration, with slightly more than half saying
they prefer a smaller government with fewer services to a larger
government with more services. Independents, however, now split 61 to 35
percent in favor of a smaller government; they were more narrowly
divided on this question a year ago (52 to 44 percent), before the
financial crisis hit.The Post calls a 54 to 41 lead for smaller
government "barely more than half," which is fair enough, though it's
twice as large as Obama's margin over McCain. It's also twice as large
as the margin the Post found in the same poll in November 2007.I've
always thought the "smaller government" question is incomplete. It
offers respondents a benefit of larger government--"more services"--but
it doesn't mention that the cost of "larger government with more
services" is higher taxes. The question ought to give both the cost and
the benefit for each option. A few years ago a Rasmussen poll did ask
the question that way. The results were that 64 percent of voters said
that they prefer smaller government with fewer services and lower taxes,
while only 22 percent would rather see a more active government with
more services and higher taxes. A similar poll around the same time,
without the information on taxes, found a margin of 59 to 26 percent. So
it's reasonable to conclude that if you remind respondents that "more
services" means higher taxes, the margin by which people prefer smaller
government rises by about 9 points. So maybe the margin in this poll
would have been something like 59 to 37 if both sides of the question
had been presented.

At the same time, there are many people who talk about dealing with the
dangers of bigger and bigger government and the budgetary burdens it
imposes on all of us. But, again, rather than focusing on fundamentals,
theirs is often only an attempt to find **short-term gimmicks** to deal
with the problems. This, too, is the result **of focusing on politics**.
It\'s often pointed out that the political preferences of voters are
distributed in the shape of a bell curve. At the ends are the political
\"extremists,\" collectivists and individualists respectively. In
between, under the dome, are the vast majority of voters who are
somewhere \"in the middle.\" If a politician is to be elected, it is
explained, he \[or she\] must appeal to a significant number in that
middle, since there are just not enough votes at either end of the curve
to win an election. Thus he \[or she\] must weave together a patchwork
of inconsistent and often contradictory positions that will reflect the
diverse political views of his potential constituents. This also limits
what market-oriented think tanks in either Washington or in the various
state capitals can offer as policy options in the debates about the role
of government. Even while seeming to be nudging the debate more in a
free-market, smaller government direction, th**e boundaries in which
they can frame their proposals are constricted by what the politicians
consider \"politically possible**.\" Beyond those boundaries the policy
advocate becomes a \"kook,\" a pie-in-the-sky \"nut,\" an extremist who
does not realize that \"nobody\" is going to take those views seriously.
The policy advocate risks losing political legitimacy and a hearing in
the halls of power-which is why his organization is located in that
center of political decision-making. **This often means that policy
proposals are \"watered down\" to be politically acceptable**. Even the
defense of a policy is often couched in terms designed to avoid the
impression that its advocates support anything as radical as, well,
laissez faire and the end to the interventionist welfare state. Any
detailed and fundamental discussion of government policy is therefore
implicitly ruled out of court. **Once attention is focused on
influencing what government is doing right now, the debate is defined by
what is politically practicable today**.

Private efforts have been much more successful than the federal
government\'s failed attempt at charity. America is the most generous
nation on earth. Americans already contribute more than \$125 billion
annually to charity. In fact, more than 85 percent of all adult
Americans make some charitable contribution each year. In addition,
about half of all American adults perform volunteer work; more than 20
billion hours were worked in 1991. The dollar value of that volunteer
work was more than \$176 billion. Volunteer work and cash donations
combined bring American charitable contributions to more than \$300
billion per year, not counting the countless dollars and time given
informally to family members, neighbors, and others outside the formal
charity system. Private charities have been more successful than
government welfare for several reasons. First, private charities are
able to individualize their approach to the circumstances of poor people
in ways that governments can never do. Government regulations must be
designed to treat all similarly situated recipients alike. Glenn C.
Loury of Boston University explains the difference between welfare and
private charities on that point. \"Because citizens have due process
rights which cannot be fully abrogated . . . public judgments must be
made in a manner that can be defended after the fact, sometimes even in
court.\" The result is that most government programs rely on the simple
provision of cash or other goods and services without any attempt to
differentiate between the needs of recipients.

## Government eligibility requirements skew aid distribution {#government-eligibility-requirements-skew-aid-distribution .Tags}

**Tanner**, director of health and welfare studies at the Cato

(Michael Tanner, director of health and welfare studies at the Cato
Institute, December 96, Cato Policy Report, "Replacing Welfare",
http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/cpr-18n6-1.html)

In addition to being better able to target individual needs, private
charities are much better able to target assistance to those who really
need help. Because eligibility requirements for government welfare
programs are arbitrary and cannot be changed to fit individual
circumstances, many people in genuine need do not receive assistance,
while benefits often go to people who do not really need them. More than
40 percent of all families living below the poverty level receive no
government assistance. Yet more than half of the families receiving
means-tested benefits are not poor. Thus, a student may receive food
stamps, while a homeless man with no mailing address goes without.
Private charities are not bound by such bureaucratic restrictions.

http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/cpr-18n6-1.html)

Private charity also has a better record of actually delivering aid to
recipients. Surprisingly little of the money being spent on federal and
state social welfare programs actually reaches recipients. In 1965, 70
cents of every dollar spent by the government to fight poverty went
directly to poor people. Today, 70 cents of every dollar goes, not to
poor people, but to government bureaucrats and others who serve the
poor. Few private charities have the bureaucratic overhead and
inefficiency of government programs.

Second, in general, private charity is much more likely to be targeted
to short-term emergency assistance than to long-term dependence. Thus,
private charity provides a safety net, not a way of life. Moreover,
private charities may demand that the poor change their behavior in
exchange for assistance. For example, a private charity may reduce or
withhold benefits if a recipient does not stop using alcohol or drugs,
look for a job, or avoid pregnancy. Private charities are much more
likely than government programs to offer counseling and one-on-one
follow-up rather than simply provide a check. By the same token, because
of the separation of church and state, the government cannot support
programs that promote religious values as a way out of poverty. Yet
church and other religious charities have a history of success in
dealing with the problems that often lead to poverty.

Finally, and perhaps most important, private charity requires a
different attitude on the part of both recipients and donors. For
recipients, private charity is not an entitlement but a gift carrying
reciprocal obligations. As Father Robert Sirico of the Acton Institute
describes it, \"An impersonal check given without any expectations for
responsible behavior leads to a damaged sense of self-worth. The beauty
of local \[private charitable\] efforts to help the needy is that . . .
they make the individual receiving the aid realize that he must work to
live up to the expectations of those helping him out.\" Private charity
demands that donors become directly involved. Former Yale political
science professor James Payne notes how little citizen involvement there
is in government charity:

Private charity demands that donors become directly involved. Former
Yale political science professor James Payne notes how little citizen
involvement there is in government charity: We know now that in most
cases of government policy making, decisions are not made according to
the democratic ideal of control by ordinary citizens. Policy is made by
elites, through special interest politics, bureaucratic pressures, and
legislative manipulations. Insiders decide what happens, shaping the
outcome according to their own preferences and their political pull. The
citizens are simply bystanders. Private charity, in contrast, is based
on \"having individuals vote with their own time, money, and energy.\"

Ultimately, the struggle to achieve and preserve freedom must take place
in the habits and minds of individuals. And, as admonished by the
Constitution of the State of North Carolina (Art. I, Sec. 35), \"The
frequent reference to fundamental principles is absolutely necessary to
preserve the blessings of liberty.\'\' It is those fundamental
principles that deliver economic efficiency and wealth, not the other
way around. [Fundamental moral principles or values are determined in
the arena of civil society. Values such as thrift, hard work, honesty,
trust and cooperative behavior, based on shared norms, are the keys to
improving the human condition and provide the undergirding for a
free-market economy. Just as important are such social institutions as
respect for private property, sanctity of contracts, educational
institutions, clubs, charities, churches, and families]{.underline}.
[All those institutions provide the glue to hold society together in
terms of common values and provide for the transmission of those values
to successive generations]{.underline}. Too often [informal institutions
and local networks are trivialized]{.underline} and greater favor is
given to the intellectual\'s narrow conception of what constitutes
knowledge and wisdom. [The importance of informal networks]{.underline}
such as friends, church members, neighbors, and families [cannot be
underestimated\--as demonstrated in]{.underline} the following example
of small [proprietorships]{.underline}.\[1\] The critical determinants
of a proprietor\'s success are perseverance, character, ability, and
other personal characteristics. [Banks seldom finance the establishment
of such business. Most small businesses are financed through friends and
family. The reason is that those are the people who have the lowest cost
in acquiring the necessary information about the proprietor\'s
characteristics deemed critical for success]{.underline}. [Also, friends
and family, who lend the proprietor money, have a personal stake in the
business and have an incentive to moderate their likely bias in favor of
the borrower.]{.underline} Clearly, a formal lending institution could
query friends and relatives. However, the information obtained would
have greater bias because friends and relatives would not have
sufficient stake in the business to offset any personal bias they had in
favor of the borrower.

## Privatization promotes choice and increases quality of services to all people {#privatization-promotes-choice-and-increases-quality-of-services-to-all-people .Tags}

The case for privatization includes other claims besides improved
efficiency, budget savings, and increased economic growth. The key word
is choice. Advocates claim that privatization will enlarge the range of
choice for individuals while serving the same essential functions as do
traditional programs. Thus, if Social Security were privatized, the
Federal government would still require people to put aside funds for
retirement but would allow them to choose their own retirement
invest­ments. Educational vouchers would not abolish laws requiring
children to go to school but would allow families to choose which one.
Asset sales and shifts of services from public agencies to private
contractors might permit greater choice among suppliers. Proponents of
privatization maintain that greater choice would serve the in­terests of
equity. The rich have always been able to afford private schools;
educa­tional vouchers would give the middle classes and the poor that
ability. Social Security, they say, favors whites, whose longer life
expectancy enables them to receive greater retirement benefits than do
blacks; privatization would allegedly correct that bias. According to
the privatizers, greater freedom of choice will gener­ally lead to a more
just distribution of benefits.

## Product choice because of privatization will resolve the inefficiency preventing high quality goods and services {#product-choice-because-of-privatization-will-resolve-the-inefficiency-preventing-high-quality-goods-and-services .Tags}

Choice is unquestionably the single strongest point in the case for
privatiza­tion. The uniformity of public programs and services is often a
grave limitation. Even where it is not logically required, the demands
of equal treatment are often interpreted to prohibit heterogeneity in
public services. Rules requiring uniform pricing also impede the
production of varied services, especially those of high quality. These
barriers to heterogeneity have long been a weakness of public ser­vices,
but the problem grows more serious as personal income increases with
eco­nomic growth. Larger numbers of consumers demand the more varied,
specially designed services available previously only to those with the
highest incomes. This demand for quality---or rather for different
qualities --- constitutes a source of dis­satisfaction with the public
sector that may be expected to grow.

/A.C.

For large charities such as the Salvation Army and smaller local
charities run by churches and other private organizations, the fight
against poverty has been going on for the past 150 years. Tragically,
**standing in their way has been the federal government**. Besides an
effort to wage "war" on poverty beginning in the 1960s, the federal
government has attempted to intercede and dole out aid since the
beginning of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. These interventions have
proven costly and yielded disastrous results. **By continually siphoning
funds away from the private sector**, **lawmakers** and bureaucrats
further **diminish the ability of civil society to deal with the problem
of poverty.** (As Charles Murray shows in **[Losing
Ground]{.underline}**, poverty was declining steadily through the 1950s
and 1960s up until the Great Society programs kicked in during the early
1970s.)

If the plight of the poor is to be truly addressed, Americans should
study the lessons of the past. Earlier in the twentieth century, private
charities offered a more effective cure for chronic indigence, and it
was through mutually beneficial activities and voluntary funding that
the spirit of American compassion was unleashed. **In the best interests
of the poor**, **the government should withdraw itself completely from
all activities designed to help them and allow civil society its full
range of motion**.

Unfortunately, most social commentators see increased state action as
the best (indeed, the only) way to fight poverty. With apologies to Ian
McEwan, the welfare state has become "the repository of collective
fantasy." Private charities, they often argue, financed by volunteers
and private donations, cannot meet the immense burden of welfare
provision. Advocates of public assistance see "private enterprise" as an
economic system that functions on Hobbesian self-interest and that would
leave the poor to suffer if profit could not be squeezed from their
labor.

Many proponents of laissez faire recognize these common protestations,
but are unable to provide cogent rebuttal. On the surface it would seem
that only government, with its vast infrastructure and immense financial
resources, can improve the plight of the poor. Private charities,
subject to the vagaries of voluntary donations, are a far less reliable
source of income.

Yet if this were the case, how is it that after more than 40 years since
the Great Society and more than \$8 trillion spent (in 2000 dollars) so
little headway has been made by the government in alleviating poverty?
This is not to say that poverty has not diminished in America. Indeed,
the market economy has virtually eliminated extreme poverty in the
United States. The average poor American lives a lifestyle that would be
envied by most of the world's citizens. But this is a product of the
market economy not government handouts. It is only through wealth
creation, not wealth distribution, that we see the wellspring of human
progress.

/A.C.

For some period of time there has been considerable evidence that
private charity is superior to government welfare as a means of
overcoming poverty in America. Empirical data suggests that private
charity indeed would do more for the poverty-level families of this
nation than is being achieved under the present welfare system. However,
we must not conclude that this seemingly radical plan is anything new in
the annals of mankind. In the nineteenth century one of England's most
powerful voices for social reform, Charles Dickens, professed a belief
in private charity as opposed to public charity. He opposed government
charity because of its ineffectiveness. He was convinced that the
polestar of charity was the human being's innate concern for another
creature. He felt that the aid and assistance extended by private
persons was more powerful, useful, and kind than the charity of
government. Just to cite his views is to affirm the favored position of
private charity, as in the following statement: Following the Napoleonic
Wars much discontent and unrest prevailed in England, but instead of
revolution the Victorian Age brought relative peace, manifested by great
reforms such as the Reform Acts of 1832, the Factory Reform of 1833, and
the Poor Laws of 1834. With these reforms passed, the general bent of
the programs was to treat the symptoms of poverty, not the causes. As a
result, there was a great alienation of the working masses and only
partial satisfaction within the commercial and industrial strata of
society. That is the very same complaint we hear today concerning our
welfare laws: alienation of welfare clients and complaint of the
taxpayers who are shouldering the burden of the necessary taxation to
support the system. Today in the United States the bulk of the donating
public make their contributions to philanthropy by taxes through their
government or privately to organized charities. There is negligible
warmth of heart between the public donors (taxpayers) and the
recipients---albeit, there is slight concern by those giving funds as to
direct knowledge of the state of affairs or indigency of the
beneficiaries. There is undoubtedly more concern in this regard in the
case of private charities. Also, there is some little suspicion on the
part of many contributors that a considerable number of those who ask
for charity are undeserving. This same attitude was true during Dickens'
time when, beginning about 1818, the upper classes made attempts to
protect themselves by forming a Mendicity Society, where subscribers
contributed funds to the Society rather than give directly to beggars.
The Society investigated each case to see if each had merit.

/A.C.

The adoption of welfare state procedures and plans tends to encourage
the destructive activity of the modern state in the mass liquidation and
redistribution of wealth. The normal and hitherto accepted role of
government has been to maintain law, justice, and order, defend the
nation abroad, and to permit every man the ownership of his property. In
general, the government's business in the past was to protect the common
welfare of its citizens.

The destructive effect of the welfare state is manifested in its
expropriation, taxation, or arbitrary creation of money and credit---all
done in the name of the poor. The effect of this damaging tendency is to
abolish the independent citizen and foster the idea that all the people
should look to Washington for subsistence---i.e., to become parasites,
wholly dependent on government for all their needs and wants. With this
tendency, the politicians follow a short-term expediency of approving
sophisticated theft (in redistributing the wealth) without regard to
ultimately damaging long-term results.

The very people who have done so much and will do so much in aiding
private charity---the great middle class---are economically squeezed by
the welfare state and find its capacity to support private charity
greatly diminished.

From start to finish, what private charities do is a manifestation of
free will. No one is compelled to provide assistance. No one is coerced
to pay for it. No one is required to accept it. All parties come
together of their own, individual volition. And that's the magic of it.
The link between the giver, the provider, and the receiver is strong
precisely because each knows he can walk away from it at the slightest
hint of insincerity, broken promises, or poor performance. Because each
party is giving of his own time or resources voluntarily, he tends to
focus on the mission at hand and doesn't get bogged down or diverted by
distant or secondary agendas[,]{.underline} like filling out the proper
paperwork or currying favor with the political powers-that-be.

There are probably more solutions than there are causes for poverty. The
reason is that many \"solutions\" are not well considered, and sometimes
they actually worsen the condition of the poor. Clearly, effective help
for the poor takes more than just good intentions. Wealth and poverty
have been important topics in economics for more than 200 years since
Adam Smith, a professor of moral philosophy, published The Wealth of
Nations in 1776. One of the most important contributions made recently
to the literature is by Jennifer Roback Morse, a fellow economist who is
a person of deep religious conviction. Morse has compared government
welfare and private charity in a way that helps to understand the issue
in a new light. She points out that **private charity operates to treat
particular causes of poverty**. The help is tailored to the individual
person. By contrast, government welfare does not, and should not,
discriminate among recipients. The discretion of social workers must be
circumscribed in order to reduce corruption in the system.

We obtained the interesting result that a decrease in state and local
government spending on education increases private giving to education,
and that increased education giving then leads to a reduction in federal
government spending on education. We argued that this one-way
relationship is a result of changing fundraising efforts and the nature
of state and local government versus federal government education
expenditures (general appropriations versus grants, respectively) and
the relative size of each toward total education expenditures. In
addition to a reduction in private charitable contributions resulting
from government spending on charitable organizations, government growth
itself, ignoring the destination of government spending, may reduce
private charitable contributions. Private contributions may decrease
because of reduced disposable income that results from higher taxes used
to fuel future government growth.

I have also tried to show that attempts to subvert utilitarianism
through appeals to formal properties about theories of justice---such as
finality and publicity---do not work either. The finality of
utilitarianism is unlikely to be in jeopardy in a world in which people
cannot suffer horrible acts as patients or alienating acts as agents.
The rules protecting self-ownership, which are necessary to prevent
exploitation, also forbid the horrible acts and allow individuals the
liberty to do much of what they see as with their lives. The question of
utilitarianism\'s subversion in its finality by grossly, unfair
distributive arrangements is answered by a set of institutions in which
no deep suffering is allowed and a generous provision is made for
educational opportunities for all.

Perhaps the clearest illustration of this compromise or balancing
principle is the distinction drawn in constitutional jurisprudence
between the standard of review applied by courts in deciding whether
legislative enactments comply with the Equal Protection Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. Laws that do not infringe on certain
constitutionally protected rights will pass muster if there is a mere
rational basis for their enactment, whereas laws that do infringe on
such rights require more compelling justification, with the level of
justification varying depending on the right at issue. 196 Human rights
claims have bite precisely because they declare that certain actions may
be improper, even if those actions are supported by a majority of the
population, indeed, even if the actions in question would increase the
total utility of the population as a whole. But it is not necessary to
take the position that rights-based claims should always trump
conflicting utility-maximizing purposes. 197 It should be possible to
honor multiple goals in public policy decision-making.

Even in a world full of rules and institutions---like that of
Imperfectia---there is still normative work for utilitarianism to do.
The foundation for this work stems from an argument in chapter 1 that
the work of utilitarianism is more likely a form of local rather than
global maximizing, of making the best use of new information and
opportunities on the margin rather than a complete revolution of social
relations. In imperfect worlds, this work thus includes local
maximization, constitutional change, and exceptional case guidance. In
addition there is a kind of distinctive normative work specifically for
utilitarians in venal oligarchies. To provide anything like a full
theory of any of these things here would require an entire new book.
What I do provide is merely a series of thumbnail sketches of the
problems. The aim is to show that there is still plenty of value in a
consciously held global theory of utilitarianism, and therefore we
should not fall hack only on common sense and whatever reasonable
institutions are lying about.

Richard. Morality, Utilitarianism, and Rights. Cambridge University

Before turning to possible \" deeper\" difficulties, let me make just
one point favorable to [the utilitarian view]{.underline}, that it
[tells us]{.underline}, in principle, [how to find out what are a
person\'s rights, and how stringent they are, relative to each other,
which is much more than can be said of most other theories, unless
reliance on intuitions is supposed to be a definite way of telling what
a person\'s rights are.]{.underline} How does one do this, on the
utilitarian theory? The idea, of course, is that [we have to determine
whether it would maximize long-range expectable utility to include
recognition of certain rights in the moral code of a society, or to
include a certain right with a certain degree of stringency as compared
with other rights. (For instance, it might be optimistic to include a
right to life with more stringency than a right to liberty and this with
more stringency than the right to pursue happiness.)]{.underline}
Suppose, for instance, one wants to know what should be the scope of the
\" right to life.\" Then it would be proper to inquire whether the
utility-maximizing moral system would require people to retrain from
taking the life of other adults, more positively to support life by
providing adequate medical care, to abstain from life-termination for
seriously defective infants or to refrain from abortion, to require
abstaining from assisting a person with terminal illness in ending his
own life if he requests it, to refrain from assisting in the discharge

Libertarianism,\" *Critical Review*, Volume: 3, pp. 435-436)

The effect of libertarian straddling on libertarian scholarship is
suggested by a passage in the scholarly appendix to Boaz's collection of
libertarian essays, The Libertarian Reader. There, Tom G. Palmer (also
of the Cato Institute) writes that in libertarian scholarship, "the
moral imperatives of peace and voluntary cooperation are brought
together with a rich understanding of the spontaneous order made
possible by such voluntary cooperation, and of the ways in which
coercive intervention can disorder the world and set in motion complex
trains of unintended consequences" (Boaz r997b, 416, emphasis added).
Palmer's ambiguous "brought together" suggests (without coming right out
and saying) that even if there were no rich understanding of spontaneous
order, libertarianism would be sustained by "moral imperatives?' But in
that case, why develop the rich understanding of spontaneous order in
the first place, and why emphasize its importance now that it has been
developed? Spontaneous order is, on Palmer's own terms, irrelevant,
since even if a rich understanding of it yielded the conclusion that
markets are less orderly or less spontaneous than states, or that the
quality of the order they produce is inferior to that produced by
states, we would still be compelled to be libertarians by moral
imperatives. The premise of the philosophical approach is that nothing
can possibly trump freedom-cum-private property. But if libertarian
freedom is an end in itself and is the greatest of all values, one's
endorsement of it should not be affected in the slightest by such
empirical questions as whether libertarianism would spell starvation or
warfare. The premise of the empirical approach is, conversely, that such
consequences do matter. Why investigate the effects of libertarianism if
they could not conceivably outweigh the putative intrinsic value of
private property? If a priori reasoning tells us that laissez-faire
capitalism is just, come what may, then why should we care to find out
what may, in fact, come?

On the one hand, the reclamation of the Enlightenment legacy can lead in
far more directions than the political---science path I have suggested.
It is surely important to launch anthropological, economic, historical,
sociological, and psychological investigations of the preconditions of
human happiness. And post-libertarian cultural historians and critics
are uniquely positioned to analyze the unstated assumptions that take
the place of the requisite knowledge in determining democratic
attitudes. A prime candidate would seem to be the overwhelming focus on
intentions as markers for the desirability of a policy. If a policy is
well intended, this is usually taken to be a decisive consideration in
its favor. This heuristic might explain the moralism that observers
since Tocqueville have noticed afflicts democratic cultures. To date,
this phenomenon is relatively unexplored. Analogous opportunities for
insightful postlibertarian research can be found across the spectrum of
political behavior. What is nationalism, for example, if not a device
that helps an ignorant public navigate the murky waters of politics by
applying a simple "us-versus-them" test to any proposed policy? Pursuit
of these possibilities, however, must be accompanied by awareness of the
degeneration of postwar skepticism into libertarian ideology. If the
post-libertarian social scientist yields to the hope of re-establishing
through consequentialist research the antigovernment politics that has
until now been sustained by libertarian ideology; she will only recreate
the conditions that have served to retard serious empirical inquiry. It
is fashionable to call for political engagement by scholars and to deny
the possibility that one can easily isolate one's work from one's
political sympathies. But difficulty is no excuse for failing to try.
Libertarians have even less of an excuse than most, since, having for so
long accused the intellectual mainstream of bias and insulation from
refutation, they should understand better than anyone the importance of
subverting one's own natural intellectual complacency with the constant
reminder that one might be wrong. The only remedy for the sloppiness
that has plagued libertarian scholarship is to become one's own harshest
critic. This means thinking deeply and skeptically about one's politics
and its premises and, if one has libertarian sympathies, directing one's
scholarship not at vindicating them, but at finding out if they are
mistaken.

Performance is the test. Asked directly by a Western interviewer, "In
principle, do you believe in one standard of human rights and free
expression?", Lee immediately answers, "Look, it is not a matter of
principle but of practice." This might appear to represent a simple and
rather crude pragmatism. But in its context it might also be interpreted
as an appreciation of the fundamental point made by Max Weber that, in
politics, it is "the ethic of responsibility" rather than "the ethic of
absolute ends" that is appropriate. While an individual is free to treat
human rights as absolute, to be observed whatever the cost, governments
must always weigh consequences and the competing claims of other ends.
So once they enter the realm of politics, human rights have to take
their place in a hierarchy of interests, including such basic things as
national security and the promotion of prosperity. Their place in that
hierarchy will vary with circumstances, but no responsible government
will ever be able to put them always at the top and treat them as
inviolable and over-riding. The cost of implementing and promoting them
will always have to be considered.

As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and
Hannah Arendt have taught, an unyielding concern with moral goodness
undercuts political responsibility. The concern may be morally laudable,
reflecting a kind of personal integrity, but it suffers from three fatal
flaws: (1) It fails to see that the purity of one's intention does not
ensure the achievement of what one intends. Abjuring violence or
refusing to make common cause with morally compromised parties may seem
like the right thing; but if such tactics entail impotence, then it is
hard to view them as serving any moral good beyond the clean conscience
of their supporters; (2) it fails to see that in a world of real
violence and injustice, moral purity is not simply a form of
powerlessness; it is often a form of complicity in injustice. This is
why, from the standpoint of politics\--as opposed to religion\--pacifism
is always a potentially immoral stand. In categorically repudiating
violence, it refuses in principle to oppose certain violent injustices
with any effect; and (3) it fails to see that politics is as much about
unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of
action, rather than the motives of action, that is most significant.
Just as the alignment with "good" may engender impotence, it is often
the pursuit of "good" that generates evil. This is the lesson of
communism in the twentieth century: it is not enough that one's goals be
sincere or idealistic; it is equally important, always, to ask about the
effects of pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic
and historically contextualized ways. Moral absolutism inhibits this
judgment. It alienates those who are not true believers. It promotes
arrogance. And it undermines political effectiveness.

## Utilitarianism key to policy making {#utilitarianism-key-to-policy-making .Tags}

professor of law at USC, 1984 Hofstra Law Journal. "The Utilitarian
Imperative: Autonomy, Reciprocity, and Evolution" HeinOnline)

Evolutionary progression toward majoritarian decision-making follows
from the utilitarian function of social organization to enhance human
need/want fulli1lment." Because the need/want preference of community
members are best known to them, resource allocations and behavior
constraints that significantly reflect their in- put best implement
those preferences. The need/want fulfillment of such members expands
with their approval of community decision-making institutions. Such
approval lowers the costs of dissenter disruption while increasing
psychological security and productive efficiency. The utilitarian
enhanced-fulfillment goal is most effectively implemented by communities
that optimize (not maximize) individual participation in policy
formulation. Optimal participation involves the selection of capable
officials who make independent community fulfillment decisions but
remain subject to effective community supervision. Self-constrained
majoritarianism thus appears to be the evolving political counterpart of
utilitarianism, a continuity suggested by the progression of western
nations from autocracy toward representative democracy, the enhanced
need/want fulfillment that has accompanied the progression, and the
inability of totalitarian governments to match that fulfillment.

The distinction I shall here propose works along a dimension orthogonal
to that one. Instead of differentiating utilitarianisms on the basis of
what they are used to choose, I suggest doing so on the basis of who is
supposed to use the utilirarian calculus to make choices, Implicitly,
contemporary discussions of varieties of utilitatianism are all
standardly addresses, first and foremost, to individuals acting in their
personal capacities and making choices which, while they may affect
others as well, principally affect the chooser's own lives, Implicitly,
public officials' choices of general social policy. A different menu of
options -- in some respects greater, in others, less, but in any case
different- is available to public and private users. That, I submit, is
a fallacy. [It does not matter who is using the utilitarian calculus, in
what circumstances and for what purposes. Using the felicific calculus
for micro-level purposes of guiding individuals choices of personal
conduct is altogether different from using it for macro-level purposes
of guiding public officials' shoices of general social
policy]{.underline}. A different menu of options -- in some respects
greater, in others, less, but in any case different -- is available to
public and private choosers. Those differences are such as to neutralize
in the public sphere, [most of the objections standardly lodged against
utilitarianism in the private sphere]{.underline}. True through [such
complaints may be as applied to utilitarianism as a standard of personal
conduct, they are irrelevant (or anyway much less problematic) as

(Sissela Bok, Prof. Phil. Brandeis, 1988, *Applied Ethics and Ethical

The same argument can be made for Kant's other formulations of the
Categorical Imperative: "So act as to use humanity, both in your own
person and in the person of every other, always at the same time as an
end, never simply as a means"; and "So act as if you were always through
actions a law-making member in a universal Kingdom of Ends." No one with
a concern for humanity could consistently will to risk eliminating
humanity in the person of himself and every other or to risk the death
of all members in a universal Kingdom of Ends for the sake of justice.
To risk their collective death for the sake of following one's
conscience would be, as Rawls said, "irrational, crazy." And to say that
one did not intend such a catastrophe, but that one merely failed to
stop other persons from bringing it about would be beside the point when
the end of the world was at stake. For although it is true that we
cannot be held responsible for most of the wrongs that others commit,
the Latin maxim presents a case where we would have to take such a
responsibility seriously---perhaps to the point of deceiving, bribing,
even killing an innocent person, in order that the world not perish.

## Utilitarianism necessitates public policy that requires that leaders take the action which is in the best interest of people {#utilitarianism-necessitates-public-policy-that-requires-that-leaders-take-the-action-which-is-in-the-best-interest-of-people .Tags}

**Shaw Philosophy Professor 1999** (William H. Shaw, 1999, Philosophy
and Chair of the Philosophy at SJSU, "contemporary ethics: taking
account of utilitarianism" p 171-2)

Utilitarianism ties right and wrong to the promotion of well-being, but
it is not only n personal ethic or a guide to individual conduct. lt is
also a \"public philosophy°\" - that is, a normative basis for public
policy and the structuring of our social, legal, and political
institutions. Indeed, it was just this aspect of utilitarianism that
primarily engaged Bentham, john Stuart Mill, his father James, and their
friends and votaries. For them utilitarianism was, first and foremost, a
social and political philosophy and only secondarily a private or
personal moral code. In particular, they saw utilitarianism as providing
the yardstick by which to measure, assess, and, where necessary, reform
government social and economic policy and the judicial institutions of
their day. In the public realm, utilitarianism is especially compelling.
Because of its consequentialist character, a utilitarian approach to
public policy requires officials to base their actions, procedures, and
programs on the most accurate and detailed understanding they can obtain
of the circum- stances in which they are operating and the likely
results of the alternatives open to them. Realism and empiricism are the
hallmarks of a utilitarian orientation, not customary practice,
unverified abstractions, or wishful Promotion of the well being of all
seems to be the appropriate, indeed the only sensible, touchstone for
assessing public policies and institutions, and the standard objections
to utilitarianism as a personal morality carry little or no weight
against it when viewed as a public philosophy. Consider, for instance,
the criticisms that utilitarianism is too impersonal and ignores one\'s
individual attachments and personal commitments, that it is coldly
calculating and concerned only with maximizing, that it demands too much
of moral agents and that it permits one to violate certain basic moral
restraints on the treatment of others. The previous two chapters
addressed sorne of these criticisms; others will be dealt with in
Chapter 8. The point here, though, is that far from undermining
utilitarianism as a public philosophy, these criticisms highlight its
strengths. We want public officials to be neutral, impersonal. and
detached and to proceed with their eyes firmly on the effects of the
policies they pursue and the institutions that their decisions shape.
Policy making requires public officials to address general issues,
typical conditions. and common circum- stances. Inevitably, they must do
this through general rules, not on a case by case basis. As explained
later in this chapter, this fact precludes public officials from
violating the rights of individuals as a matter of policy. Moreover, by
organizing the efforts of countless individuals and compelling each of
us to play our part in collective endeavors to enhance welfare, public
officials can make it less likely that utilitarianism will demand too
much of any one individual because others are doing too little.
Utilitarians --- will seek to direct and coordinate people\'s actions
through effective public policy and to reshape, in utility-enhancing
ways, the institutions that structure the choices people face. By doing
so, utilitarians can usually accomplish more good than they can through
isolated individual action, however dedicated and well intentioned. For
this reason, they will strive to Easter institutions that false over
from individuals much of the task of promoting the general welfare of
society. General welfare is a broad goal, of course, and sensible
policies and institutions will typically focus on more specific
desiderata - such as promoting productivity, increasing individual
freedom and opportunity, improving people's physical health,
guaranteeing their personal security, and so on --- that contribute
significantly to people\'s well-being. Implementing even there goals can
prove difficult. Furthermore, many of the problems facing society have
no simple answers because they are tangled up with contested issues of
fact and controversial questions of psychology, sociology, and
economics. To the extent that utilitarians disagree among · themselves
over these matters, their policy recommendations will diverge.
Nevertheless, by clarifying what is at stake and continually orienting
discussion toward the promotion of well-being, a. utilitarian approach
provides the necessary framework for addressing questions of
institutional design and for fashioning effective public policy. The
present chapter explicates the utilitarian approach to three matters
that have long engaged social and political philosophers and that
concern.

## At the same time, [deontologically based]{.underline} ethical [systems]{.underline} [have severe practical limitations as a basis for public policy.]{.underline} At best, [a priori moral principles provide only general guidance to ethical dilemmas in public affairs]{.underline} and do not themselves suggest appropriate public policies, and at worst, [they create]{.underline} a regimen of regulatory [unreasonableness while failing to adequately address the problem or actually making it worse.]{.underline} For example, a moral obligation to preserve the environment by no means implies the best way, or any way for that matter, to do so, just as [there is no a priori reason to believe that any policy that *claims* to preserve the environment will actually do so.]{.underline} Any number of policies might work, and others, although seemingly consistent with the moral principle, will fail utterly. That deontological principles are an inadequate basis for environmental policy is evident in the rather significant irony that most forms of deontologically based environmental laws and regulations tend to be implemented in a very utilitarian manner by street-level enforcement officials. Moreover, ignoring the relevant costs and benefits of environmental policy and their attendant incentive structures can, as alluded to above, actually work at cross purposes to environmental preservation. (There exists an extensive literature on this aspect of regulatory enforcement and the often perverse outcomes of regulatory policy. See, for example, Ackerman, 1981; Bartrip and Fenn, 1983; Hawkins, 1983, 1984; Hawkins and Thomas, 1984.) [Even the most die-hard]{.underline} preservationist/[deontologist]{.underline} [would]{.underline}, I believe, [be troubled by this outcome.]{.underline} The above points are perhaps best expressed by Richard Flathman, [The number of values]{.underline} typically [involved in public policy]{.underline} decisions, the broad categories which must be employed [and]{.underline} above all, [the scope and complexity of the consequences]{.underline} to be anticipated [militate against reasoning so conclusively that they generate an imperative to institute a specific policy.]{.underline} It is seldom the case that only one policy will meet the criteria of the public interest (1958, p. 12). It therefore follows that in a democracy, [policymakers have an ethical duty to establish a plausible link between policy alternatives and the problems they address]{.underline}, and the public must be reasonably assured that a policy will actually do something about an existing problem; [this requires]{.underline} the means-end language and methodology of [utilitarian ethics.]{.underline} [Good intentions, lofty rhetoric, and moral piety are]{.underline} an [insufficient]{.underline}, though perhaps at times a necessary, basis for public policy in a democracy.

[Cummiskey, 1996]{.underline} (David, Associate Philosophy Professor at
Bates College, [Kantian]{.underline}

Consequentialism, p. 145-146)

## We must not obscure the issue by characterizing this type of case as the sacrifice of individuals for some abstract "social entity." It is not a question of some persons having to bear the cost for some elusive "overall social good." Instead, the question is whether some persons must bear the inescapable cost for the sake of other persons. Robert Nozick, for example, argues that "to use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he is a separate person, that his is the only life he has." But why is this not equally true of all those whom we do not save through our failure to act? [By emphasizing solely the one who must bear the cost if we act, we fail to sufficiently respect]{.underline} and take account of [the many other separate persons, each with only one life, who will bear the cost of our inaction]{.underline}. In such a situation, what would a conscientious Kantian agent, an agent motivated by the unconditional value of rational beings, choose? A morally good agent recognizes that the basis of all particular duties is the principle that "rational nature exists as an end in itself" (GMM 429). Rational nature as such is the supreme objective end of all conduct. [If one truly believes that all rational beings have an equal value, then the rational solution to such a dilemma involves maximally promoting the lives and liberties of as many]{.underline} rational beings [as possible]{.underline} (chapter 5). In order to avoid this conclusion, the non-consequentialist Kantian needs to justify agent-centered constraints. As we saw in chapter 1, however, even most Kantian deontologists recognize that agent-centered constraints require a non- value-based rationale. But we have seen that Kant's normative theory is based on an unconditionally valuable end. How can a concern for the value of rational beings lead to a refusal to sacrifice rational beings even when this would prevent other more extensive losses of rational beings? If the moral law is based on the value of rational beings and their ends, then what is the rationale for prohibiting a moral agent from maximally promoting these two tiers of value? [If I sacrifice some for the sake of others, I do not use them arbitrarily, and I do not deny]{.underline} the [unconditional value]{.underline} of rational beings. [Persons]{.underline} may [have "dignity]{.underline}, that is, an unconditional and incomparable worth" [that transcends any market value]{.underline} (GMM 436), [but persons also have a fundamental equality that dictates that some must sometimes give way for the sake of others]{.underline} (chapters 5 and 7). [The concept of the end-in-itself does not support the view that we may never force another to bear some cost in order to benefit others]{.underline}. [If one focuses on the equal value of all rational beings, then equal consideration suggests that one may have to sacrifice some to save many]{.underline}.

Over the years, [the principle of utilitarianism has been expanded and
refined so that today there are many variations of the
principle.]{.underline} For example, Bentham defined benefits and harms
in terms of pleasure and pain. John Stuart Mill, a great 19th century
utilitarian figure, spoke of benefits and harms not in terms of pleasure
and pain alone but in terms of the quality or intensity of such pleasure
and pain. [Today utilitarians]{.underline} often [describe benefits and
harms in terms of the satisfaction of personal preferences or in purely
economic terms of monetary benefits over monetary costs]{.underline}.
[Utilitarians also differ in their views about the kind of question we
ought to ask ourselves when making an ethical decision. Some
utilitarians maintain that in making an ethical decision, we must ask
ourselves: \"What effect will my doing this act in this situation have
on the general balance of good over evil?\"]{.underline} [If lying would
produce the best consequences in a particular situation, we ought to
lie.]{.underline} Others, known as rule utilitarians, claim that we must
choose that act that conforms to the general rule that would have the
best consequences. In other words, we must ask ourselves: \"What effect
would everyone\'s doing this kind of action have on the general balance
of good over evil[?\" So, for example, the rule \"to always tell the
truth\" in general promotes the good of everyone and therefore should
always be followed, even if in a certain situation lying would produce
the best consequences.]{.underline} Despite such differences among
utilitarians, however, [most hold to the general principle that morality
must depend on balancing the beneficial and harmful consequences of our
conduct.]{.underline}

consequences,**]{.underline} of those policies surviving the
impartiality test. In the first stage deliberation takes place over the
various policies to determine whether or not they meet ethical criteria.
[A policy is determined to be ethical if (a) it does not cause any
unnecessary harm to individuals and groups and (b) it supports
individual rights, the fulfilling of duties etc. In the second stage the
best policy is selected 'from the set of just policies arrived at in the
deliberation stage by ranking ethical policies in terms of benefits and
(justifiable) harms'. In carrying out this evaluation of policies we are
required to: '...(a) weigh carefully between the good consequences and

That undecidability resides within the decision, Derrida argues, \"that
justice exceeds law and calculation, that the unpresentable ex­ceeds the
determinable cannot and should not serve as alibi for stay­ing out of
juridico-political battles, within an institution or a state, or between
institutions or states and others.\"^109^ Indeed, \"incalculable jus­tice
requires us to calculate.\" From where do these insistences come? What
is behind, what is animating, these imperatives? It is both the
character of infinite justice as a heteronomic relationship to the
other, a relationship that because of its undecidability multiplies
responsi­bility, and the fact that \"left to itself, the incalculable and
giving *(do­natrice)* idea of justice is always very close to the bad,
even to the worst, for it can always be reappropriated by the most
perverse cal­culation.\" 170 The necessity of calculating the
incalculable thus responds to a duty, a duty that inhabits the instant
of madness and compels the decision to avoid \"the bad,\" the \"perverse
calculation,\" even \"the worst.\" This is the duty that also dwells
with deconstructive thought and makes it the starting point, the \"at
least necessary condition,\" for the organization of resistance to
totalitarianism in all its forms. And it is a duty that responds to
practical political concerns when we rec­ognize that Derrida names the
bad, the perverse, and the worst as those violences \"we recognize all
too well without yet having thought them through, the crimes of
xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, reli­gious or nationalist
fanaticism.\"

Furthermore, the duty within the decision, the obligation that
recognizes the necessity of negotiating the possibilities provided by
the impossibilities of justice, is not content with simply avoiding,
con­taining, combating, or negating the worst-violence-though it could
certainly begin with those strategies. Instead, this responsibility,
which is the responsibility of responsibility, commissions a \"utopian\"
strat­egy. Not, a strategy that is beyond all bounds of possibility so as
to be considered \"unrealistic,\" but one

which in respecting the necessity of calculation takes the possibility
summoned by the calculation as far as possible, \"must take it as far as
possible, beyond the place we find ourselves and beyond the already
identifiable zones of morality or politics or law, beyond the
distinction between national and inter­national, public and private, and
so on.\"\"\' As Derrida declares, \"The condition of possibility of this
thing called responsibility is a certain *experience and experiment of
the possibility of the impossible: the testing of the aporia* from which
one may invent the only *possible invention, the impossible
invention.\"\"\'* This leads Derrida to enunciate a proposition that
many, not the least of whom are his Habermasian critics, could hardly
have expected: \"Nothing seems to me *less* outdated than the classical
emancipatory ideal. We cannot attempt to disqualify it to­day, whether
crudely or with sophistication, at least not without treat­ing it too
lightly and forming the worst complicities.\"^14^

Residing within-and not far below the surface-of Derrida\'s account of
the experience of the undecidable as the context for the decision is the
duty of deconstructive thought, the responsibility for the other, and
the opposition to totalitarianism it entails. The Lev­inasian supplement
that Critchley argues deconstruction requires with respect to politics
thus draws out that which is already present. It is, though, perhaps an
element that needs to be drawn out, for Derrida has been candid about,
and often criticized for, his political hesitancy. In answer to a
question about the potential for translating the \"theo­retical
radicality of deconstruction\" into a \"radical political
praxis[,\"]{.underline} Derrida confessed (his term) \"that I have never
succeeded in directly relating deconstruction to *existing* political
codes and programmes.\"^115^ This [\"]{.underline}failure\" is derived
not from any apolitical sentiment within de­constructive thought but from
the \"fundamentally metaphysical\" nature of the political codes within
which both the right and the left presently operate. The problem for
politics that this disjuncture cre­ates is, according to Derrida, that
one has \"to gesture in opposite di­rections at the same time: on the one
hand to preserve a distance and suspicion with regard to the official
political codes governing reality; on the other, to intervene here and
now in a practical and engaged man­ner whenever the necessity arises.\"
This, Derrida laments, results in a \"dual allegiance\" and \"perpetual
uneasiness\" whereby the logic of an argument structured in terms of
\"on the one hand\" and \"on the other hand\" may mean that political
action, which follows from a de­cision between the competing hands, is in
the end insufficient to the intellectual promise of deconstructive
thought^16^ But in *The Other Head­ing,* Derrida\'s reflection on the
question and politics of European identity, the difficulty of
simultaneously gesturing in different direc­tions is posed in an
affirmative political manner.

Finally, the planning for post-war operations in Iraq offers another
perspective on the tangled relationship between uncertainty and
strategy. [Problems of predicting the future are at the heart of
intelligence analysis and its role in national-security strategy. While
few would question the fragility of intelligence estimates or the
chequered history of judgements made by the US intelligence
community]{.underline}, [prediction remains an important part of its
mission]{.underline}. Beyond collecting and reporting raw information,
intelligence organisations are often expected to identify trends and
consider the implications of alternative strategies on the behaviour of
allies and adversaries. To accomplish this difficult mission,
intelligence analysts must rely on two crucial resources: good analytic
tradecraft that provides transparent standards of evidence, and
subject-matter expertise that enables an appreciation for the subtleties
of complex human phenomena. But standards of evidence and subject-matter
expertise are exactly the sorts of factors decision-makers sceptical of
the reliability of prediction might be apt to discount. If uncertainty
defines the strategic environment, then what greater insight can the
expert analyst bring to bear on strategy than the generalist? This
attitude could marginalise intelligence analysis in strategic
decision-making. US planning for the aftermath of the Iraq War
exemplifies how such marginalisation has played a significant role in
recent strategic decision-making. In the judgement of Paul Pillar, the
senior US intelligence official for Middle East analysis from 2000 to
2005, 'what is most remarkable about prewar U.S. intelligence on Iraq is
not that it got things wrong and thereby misled policymakers; it is that
it played so small a role in one of the most important U.S. policy
decisions in recent decades'.26 While great volumes of ink have been
spilled in the debate over intelligence estimates of Iraqi nuclear,
biological or chemical weapons, there is much more clarity about the
intelligence community's estimates of the political environment the US
would face in post-war Iraq. Those estimates accurately predicted most
of the major challenges that developed, from insurgency and sectarian
violence to the strengthening of Iran's geopolitical hand and the
galvanising effect on foreign radical Islamists.27 The reported
expectations of most key administration officials bore little
resemblance to these predictions.28 Rumsfeld's famous distinction
between 'known unknowns' and 'unknown unknowns' came in response to a
reporter's question on the intelligence supporting assertions of
linkages between the Iraqi government and terrorist organisations.29 The
implication of his remark was that presumption of a genuine
Iraqi--terrorist linkage was justified because the absence of evidence
to support the presumption did not conclusively disprove it. Here, as
with the post-war planning assumptions, uncertainty served to level the
playing field between facts and analysis, on the one hand, and the
preconceptions of senior leadership on the other. Many of the US
government's experts on Iraq and the Arab world outside the intelligence
community were also marginalised in the planning for the Iraq War. [In
2002, the State Department launched the 'Future of Iraq Project' to
write a detailed plan for the governance of a post-Saddam democratic
Iraq. Participants included dozens of career Middle East specialists
from the State Department and the intelligence community, as well as
native Iraqis]{.underline}. The project's report covered a wide variety
of topics, from development of a constitution to the management of
municipal utilities. [In the end, however, leaders in the White House
and the Pentagon viewed the report as too pessimistic and ignored many
of its conclusions]{.underline}.30 Another well-publicised instance
where decision-makers rejected expert advice on weak grounds was the
public exchange between Pentagon civilian leaders and the Army chief of
staff regarding the number of ground troops required for successful
post-hostilities operations in Iraq[. One month prior to the invasion,
General Eric Shinseki told the Senate Armed Services Committee that
establishing security and conditions for political stability in Iraq
following the end of major combat operations would take 'several hundred
thousand' coalition ground troops]{.underline}. His estimate was based
on the application of troop-topopulation ratios from previous security
and stabilisation operations.31 [While fairly rudimentary, the thrust of
this analysis was shared by a variety of expert analysts outside the
government.]{.underline}32 Two days after Shinseki's testimony, both
Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz publicly
renounced the estimate. [Wolfowitz told the House Budget Committee that
Shinseki was 'wildly off the mark', and offered s]{.underline}everal
unsubstantiated and, in retrospect[, incorrect predictions about
post-war attitudes toward American forces among Iraqis and US
allies.]{.underline} Having made these predictions, he then proceded to
reject the validity of making predictions, insisting that the 'most
fundamental point is that we simply cannot predict \... we have no idea
what we will need unless and until we get there on the ground'.33 In
effect, [by denying the validity of prediction, Wolfowitz locked himself
into a very specific but implicit prediction that conformed to his own
preconceptions]{.underline}. The point is neither that Army generals are
always better qualified to make such judgements than civilians, nor that
hindsight shows Shinseki's judgement to be better than Wolfowitz's. It
is that the grounds for the decision that was actually made on troop
levels were conspicuously shakier than those of Shinseki's judgement,
and yet they prevailed. [The mistakes that were made in the Bush
administration's post-war planning for Iraq are entirely consistent with
a bias in decision-making against the authority of expertise in
predicting the future, and the invocation of uncertainty in this
instance became a rationale for rigidity in planning rather than
flexibility]{.underline}.

Kurasawa 04

\[Fuyuki Kurasawa, Professor of Sociology -- York University of Toronto,
"Cautionary Tales: The Global Culture of Prevention and the Work of
Foresight", Constellations, 11(4), 2004\]

When engaging in the labor of preventive foresight, the first obstacle
that one is likely to encounter from some intellectual circles is a
deep-seated skepticism about the very value of the exercise. A radically
postmodern line of thinking, for instance, would lead us to believe that
it is pointless, perhaps even harmful, to strive for farsightedness in
light of the aforementioned crisis of conventional paradigms of
historical analysis. If, contra teleological models, history has no
intrinsic meaning, direction, or endpoint to be discovered through human
reason, and if, contra scientistic futurism, prospective trends cannot
be predicted without error, then the abyss of chronological
inscrutability supposedly opens up at our feet. The future appears to be
unknowable, an outcome of chance. Therefore, rather than embarking upon
grandiose speculation about what may occur, we should adopt a pragmatism
that abandons itself to the twists and turns of history; let us be
content to formulate ad hoc responses to emergencies as they arise
[While this argument has the merit of underscoring the fallibilistic
nature of all predictive schemes, it conflates the necessary recognition
of the contingency of history with unwarranted assertions about the
latter's total opacity and indeterminacy]{.underline}. [Acknowledging
the fact that the future cannot be known with absolute certainty does
not imply abandoning the task of trying to understand what is brewing on
the horizon and to prepare for crises already coming into their own. In
fact, the incorporation of the principle of fallibility into the work of
prevention means that we must be ever more vigilant for warning signs of
disaster and for responses that provoke unintended or unexpected
consequences]{.underline} (a point to which I will return in the final
section of this paper). In addition, from a normative point of view, the
acceptance of historical contingency and of the self-limiting character
of farsightedness places the duty of preventing catastrophe squarely on
the shoulders of present generations. The future no longer appears to be
a metaphysical creature of destiny or of the cunning of reason, nor can
it be sloughed off to pure randomness. It becomes, instead, a result of
human action shaped by decisions in the present -- including, of course,
trying to anticipate and prepare for possible and avoidable sources of
harm to our successors. Combining a sense of analytical contingency
toward the future and ethical responsibility for it, the idea of early
warning is making its way into preventive action on the global stage.
Despite the fact that not all humanitarian, techno- scientific, and
environmental disasters can be predicted in advance, the multiplication
of independent sources of knowledge and detection mechanisms enables us
to foresee many of them before it is too late. Indeed, in recent years,
global civil society's capacity for early warning has dramatically
increased, in no small part due to the impressive number of NGOs that
include catastrophe prevention at the heart of their mandates. These
organizations are often the first to detect signs of trouble, to
dispatch investigative or fact-finding missions, and to warn the inter-
national community about impending dangers; to wit, the lead role of
environ- mental groups in sounding the alarm about global warming and
species depletion or of humanitarian agencies regarding the AIDS crisis
in sub-Saharan Africa, fre- quently months or even years before Western
governments or multilateral institu- tions followed suit

Philip Tetlock, one of my favorite social scientists, is making waves
with his new book, Expert Political Judgment. Tetlock spent two decades
asking hundreds of political experts to make predictions about hundreds
of issues. With all this data under his belt, he then asks and tries to
answer a bunch of Big Questions, including \"Do experts on average have
a greater-than-chance ability to predict the future?,\" and \"What kinds
of experts have the greatest forecasting ability?\" This book is
literally awesome - to understand Tetlock\'s project and see how well he
follows through fills me with awe. And that\'s tough for me to admit,
because it would be easy to interpret Tetlock\'s work as a great
refutation of my own. Most of my research highlights the systematic
belief differences between economists and the general public, and
defends the simple \"The experts are right, the public is wrong,\"
interpretation of the facts. But Tetlock finds that the average expert
is an embarassingly bad forecaster. In fact, experts barely beat what
Tetlock calls the \"chimp\" stategy of random guessing. [Is my
confidence in experts completely misplaced? I think not. Tetlock\'s
sample suffers from severe selection bias. He deliberately asked
relatively difficult and controversial questions. As his methodological
appendix explains, questions had to \"Pass the \'don\'t bother me too
often with dumb questions\' test.\" Dumb according to who? The implicit
answer is \"Dumb according to the typical expert in the field.\" What
Tetlock really shows is that experts are overconfident if you exclude
the questions where they have reached a solid consensus.]{.underline}

## Concrete decision making - Only Utilitarianism makes justifications based on the end result rather then ambiguous language {#concrete-decision-making---only-utilitarianism-makes-justifications-based-on-the-end-result-rather-then-ambiguous-language .Tags}

**Ratner, professor of law at USC, 1984** (Leonard G. Ratner p.758-9,
professor of law at USC, 1984 Hofstra Law Journal. "The Utilitarian
Imperative: Autonomy, Reciprocity, and Evolution" HeinOnline)

Disregarding the significance of evolutionary survival, nonutilitarian
intuitionists deny that utilitarianism provides a \"moral\" basis for
choice between competing need/want fulfillments. They seek instead to
identify the intuitive \"preexisting rights" that must, they insist,
underlie such choice."\' But they disclose no nonrnystical. source of
the rights,\*\'" which are, in fact, derived from the search for
increased per capita need/want fulfillment."° Although frequently
accorded a transcendental immutability, rights identify the resource and
behavior allocations that are perceived by the community as enhancing
such fulfillment. Indeed, revelation of various a priori rights or moral
standards is often accompanied by disparagement of other such rights or
standards as crypto-nti1itarian."' A priori rights divorced from
need/want fulfillment depend on the magic power of language. When not
determined by social consequences, the morality of behavior tends to be
resolved by definition of the words used to characterize the behavior.
Necessarily ambiguous generalizations, evolved to describe and correlate
heterogeneous events, acquire a controlling normative role. Definition,
of course, reflects human experience. But the equivocal significance of
that experience may be replaced with the illusory security of fixed
meaning. Ethical connotations are then drawn not from the underlying
empirical lessons that provide a context for meaning, but from
inflexible linguistic \"principles" and their emotional overtones.
Derivation of meaning from the social purposes that engender the
terminology leads to a utilitarian appraisal of need\] want fulfillment.
The preexisting rights of nonutilitarian morality are usually identified
as components of \"liberty,\" \"equality," and "autonomy,\"\'°' labels
that suggest a concern with individual need/want fulfillment and its
social constraints. Liberty is perceived as freedom for behavior that
improves the quality of existence, such as speech, religion, and other
\"civil rights" activity; equality as rejection of disparate individual
worth and \"discriminatory\" treatment; autonomy as the individual
choice implied by liberty and equality.'"

## Utilitarianism prevents nuclear war {#utilitarianism-prevents-nuclear-war .Tags}

professor of law at USC, 1984 Hofstra Law Journal. "The Utilitarian
Imperative: Autonomy, Reciprocity, and Evolution" HeinOnline)

Without effective reciprocity, self-defense is the only survival remedy.
Passive resistance to a Hitler has survival costs that are acceptable to
few communities. Rejection of those costs is perhaps being accommodated
with the intolerable survival costs of nuclear warfare by payment of
more immediate nuclear-deterrence costs." Negotiations to reduce the
nuclear-deterrence costs confront the participants with a predicament
like the \"prisone1's dilemma\""\' if nuclear weapons can escape
detection: although both participants would benefit from a reduction,
each is impelled to increase its nuclear weapons as protection against
an undetected increase by the other. But each may also be impelled to
refrain from their use. If that accommodation fails, so may the
evolutionary process. While the accommodation holds, nonnuclear self
defense re- mains the survival remedy pending a reciprocity solution.
The survival costs of nonnuclear warfare of course continue to be high,
but when the survival costs of capitulation are perceived as exceeding
them, compensation for combatants commensurate with risk would provide a
kind of market accommodation for those induced thereby to volunteer and
would reduce the disproportionate wartime-con·-scription assessment.

utilitarianism reconciles autonomy and reciprocity, surmounts the
strident intuitionist attack, and exposes the utilitarian underpinning
of a priori rights.\" In the context of the information provided by
biology, anthropology, economics, and other disciplines, a functional
description of evolutionary utilitarianism identities enhanced per
capita need/want fulfillment as the long-term utilitarian-majoritarian
goal, illuminates the critical relationship of self interest to that
goal, and discloses the trial-and-error process of accommodation and
priority assignment that implements it." The description confirms that
process as arbiter of the tension between individual welfare and group
welfare (i.e., between autonomy and reciprocity)\*° and suggests a
utilitarian imperative: that utilitarianism is unavoidable, that
morality rests ultimately on utilitarian self interest, that in the
final analysis all of us are personal utilitarians and most of us are
social utilitarians.

A home seller neglects to inform the buyer about the home's occasional
problems with flooding in the basement: The seller intentionally omits
it from the house's legally required disclosure document, and fails to
reveal it in the negotiation. A few months after the closing, the
basement is flooded and destroyed, and the buyer spends \$20,000 in
repairs. Most people would agree that the seller's unethical behavior
deserves to be punished. Now consider the same behavior on the part of a
second seller, except that it is followed by a long drought, so the
buyer never faces a flooded basement. [Bo]{.underline}th sellers were
similarly unethical, yet their behavior produced different results. In
this paper, we seek to answer the question: Do [people judge
the]{.underline} ethicality of the two sellers differently, despite the
fact that their behavior was the same? And if so, under what conditions
are people's judgments of ethicality influenced by outcome information?
Past [r]{.underline}esearch has shown some of the ways that people tend
to take outcome information into account in a manner that is not
logically justified (Baron & Hershey, 1988; Allison, Mackie, & Messick,
1996). Baron and Hershey (1988) labeled this tendency as the *outcome
bias*.

Extending prior work on the effect of outcome severity on judgments
(Berg-Cross, 1975; Lipshitz, 1989; Mitchell & Kalb, 1981; Stokes &
Leary, 1984), their research found that people judge the wisdom and
competence of decision makers based on the nature of the outcomes they
obtain. For instance, in one study participants were presented with a
hypothetical scenario of a surgeon deciding whether or not to perform a
risky operation (Baron & Hershey, 1988). The surgeon knew the
probability of success. After reading about identical decision
processes, participants learned either that the patient lived or died,
and were asked to rate the quality of the No Foul 4 surgeon's decision
to operate. When the patient died, participants decided it was a mistake
to have operated in the first place.

Let us start with a simple example, namely a suicide bomber who seeks to
detonate a nuclear device in midtown Manhattan. Obviously we would seek
to stop the bomber, or If we stop the bomber, we know that in the short
run we will save millions of lives, avoid a massive tragedy, and protect
the long-term strength, prosperity, and freedom of the United States.
Reasonable moral people, regardless of the details of their meta-ethical
stances, should not argue against stopping the bomber. No matter how
hard we try to stop the bomber, we are not, a priori, committed to a
very definite view of how effective prevention will turn out in the long
run. After all, stopping the bomber will reshuffle future genetic
identities, and may imply the birth of a future Hitler. Even trying to
stop the bomber, with no guarantee of success, will remix the future in
similar fashion.Still, we can see a significant net welfare improvement
in the short run, while facing radical generic uncertainty about the
future in any case. Furthermore, if we can stop the bomber, our long-run
welfare estimates will likely show some improvement. The bomb going off
could lead to subsequent attacks on other major cities, the emboldening
of terrorists, or perhaps broader panics. There would be a new and very
real doorway toward general collapse of the world. While the more
distant future is remixed radically, we should not rationally believe
that some new positive option has been created to counterbalance the
current destruction and the new possible negatives. To put it simply, it
is difficult to see the violent destruction of Manhattan as on net, in
ex ante terms, favoring either the short-term or long-term prospects of
the world. We can of course imagine possible scenarios where such
destruction works out for the better ex post; perhaps, for instance, the
explosion leads to a subsequent disarmament or anti-proliferation
advances. But we would not breathe a sigh of relief on hearing the news
of the destruction for the first time. Even if the long-run expected
value is impossible to estimate, we need only some probability that the
relevant time horizon is indeed short (perhaps a destructive asteroid
will strike the earth). This will tip the consequentialist balance
against a nuclear attack on Manhattan.

## **Concept of morals not mutually exclusive with utilitarianism** {#concept-of-morals-not-mutually-exclusive-with-utilitarianism .Tags}

**Brandt, professor of philosophy @ U Mich. 1992**

Richard. Morality, Utilitarianism, and Rights. Cambridge University
Press. Pg 204-205.

There is, however[, another line of thinking that connects desirability
with moral obligation for the utilitarian, and in fact **shows why a
utilitarian requires a concept of moral obligation** and what the
concept will be.]{.underline} This line of reasoning goes as follows. We
begin with the assumption that the utilitarian wants to maximize
happiness in society. Now, [he knows that one important means to his
goal, indeed the only one within our control, is human actions with that
effect. So he will want acts that produce welfare, ideally ones that
will maximize it as compared with other options]{.underline}. Let us
say, then, that he will want expedient acts as a means to happiness. But
the thoughtful utilitarian will further ask himself how he can bring it
about that people perform acts which, taken together, will maximize
happiness. One way, and surely a good way up to a point, is to employ
moral education to make people more sympathetic or altruistic; if they
become so, they will tend to act more frequently to produce happiness in
others. It looks, however, ;as if such educational encouragement of
sympathy is not enough, mainly because people are ill-informed about the
probable consequences of what they do, and in any case because the
intent to do as much good as one can may lead to action at
cross-purposes rather than to more beneficial cooperative behavior. So
[the utilitarian, who wants maximal happiness, will do something more
than just try to motivate people to aim directly at it. It will occur to
him that a legal system, with its sanctions and implicit directives,
will both guide people what to do, and at the same time provide
motivation to conform to the legal standards. He will want, with
Bentham, a legal system which as a whole will maximize happiness by
producing pro-social conduct at the least cost.]{.underline} Moreover,
the one thing should be clear: If the moral system has been carefully
devised, there will not be gross disparity between what it requires and
conduct that promises to maximize benefit. To avoid such disparity[, an
optimal rule-utilitarian moral code will contain \" escape clauses.\"
For instance, it will permit a driver to obstruct a driveway illegally
when there is an emergency situation]{.underline}. But suppose there is
a minor disparity between the requirements of the moral code and what
will do most good: suppose Mary will have to walk to work tomorrow, but
the gain in convenience to the person who obstructs her driveway will
be: greater than the loss to her. Will the consistent utilitarian then
advise the driver to park illegally? Let us suppose the utilitarian has
decided that a utility maximizing moral code will not direct a person to
do what he thinks will maximize expectable utility in a particular
situation, but to follow certain rules - roughly, to follow his
conscientious principles, as amended where long-range utility requires.
If he has decided this, then it is inconsistent of him to turn around
and advise individuals just to follow their discretion about what will
maximize utility in a particular case. Of course, the utilitarian will
want everyone to be sensitive to the utility of giving aid to others and
avoiding injury; requirements or encouragement to do so are pan of our
actual moral cede, and it is optimal for the code to be \$0. [But once
it is decided that the optimal code is not that of act-utilitarianism,
the utilitarian will say it is desirable for a person to follow the
optimal moral code, that is, follow conscience except where utility
demands amendment of the principles of the code, So it seems the
consistent utilitarian will conclude that there is a moral obligation
not to obstruct Mary\' s driveway illegally, in accordance with the
optimal code.]{.underline}

**Brandt, professor of philosophy @ U Mich. 1992**

Richard. Morality, Utilitarianism, and Rights. Cambridge University
Press. Pg 212.

[My conclusion is that if we are to be utilitarians in the sense that we
think morality should maximize long-range utility, and at the same time
think that a utilitarian morality should have room for recognition of
rights that cannot be overridden by marginal gains in utility, there are
two positions we must espouse. First, we must hold that a person does
the *right* act, or the obligatory act, not by just following his
*actual* moral principles wherever they may lead, but by following the
moral principles the acceptance of which in society would maximize
expectable utility.]{.underline} Of course, this means that people who
want to do what is right may have to do some thinking about their moral
principles in particular situations. Second, [we must emphasize that the
right act is the one permitted by or required *by the moral* code the
acceptance of which promises to maximize utility, and not compromise,
except in extreme circumstances, in order to do what in a particular
situation will maximize utility , where so doing conflicts with the
utility-maximizing code. Only if we do this will we have room for a
concept of \" a right\" which cannot be overridden by a marginal
addition to the general welfare. It is clear that acting morally in this
sense will never be very costly in utility, and where it is costly at
all, that is the price that has to be paid for *a policy,* a morality of
principle.]{.underline} If my exegesis of J. S. Mill is correct, these
recommendations are ones in which he would join.

## Utilitarianism is inevitable it will indefinitely permeate human thought

**Allison**, Professor of Political Philosophy at University of Warwick,
19**90** (Lincoln, "The Utilitarianism Response")

And yet if an idea can be compared to a castle, though we find a
breached wall, damaged foundation and a weapons spiked where not
actually destroyed, there still remains a keep, some thing central and
defensible, with in utilitarianism. As Raymond Frey puts it,
utilitarianism has never ceased to occupy a central place in moral
theorizing [.]{.underline}.. \[and\] has come to have a significant
impact upon the moral thinking of many laymen. The simple core of the
doctrine lies in the ideas that actions should be judged by their
consequences and that the best actions are those which make people, as-a
whole, better off than do the alternatives. What utilitarianism always
excludes there­fore, is any idea-about the Tightness or wrongness of
actions which is not explicable in terms of the consequences of those
actions. The wide acceptance of utilitarianism in this broad sense may
well be residual for many people[.]{.underline} Without a serious God
(one, this is, prepared to reveal Truth and instruction) or a convincing
deduction of ethical prescription from pure reason, we are likely to
turn towards Bentham and to judge actions on there consequences for
people\'s well-being[.]{.underline}

## Because of the advent of nuclear omnicide, ethics should not be held absolute 

Joseph **Nye**, Director of the Center for Science and International
Affairs @ Harvard University, [Nuclear Ethics]{.underline}, 19**86**

The significance and the limits of the two broad traditions can be
captured by contemplating a hypothetical case. Imagine that you are
visiting a Central American country and you happen upon a village square
where an army captain is about to order his men to shoot peasants lined
up against a wall. When you ask the reason, you are told someone in this
village shot at the captain's men last night. Why you object to the
killing of possibly innocent people, you are told that civil wars do not
permit moral niceties. Just to prove the point that we all have dirty
hands in such situations, the captain hands you a rifle and tells you
that if you will shoot one peasant, he will free the other. Otherwise
both die. He warns you not to try any tricks because his men have their
guns trained on you. Will you shoot one person with the consequences of
saving one, or will you allow both to die but preserve your moral
integrity by refusing to play his dirty game? The point of the story is
to show the value and limits of both traditions, Integrity is clearly an
important value, and many of us would refuse to shoot. But at what point
does the principle of not taking an innocent life collapse before the
consequentialist burden? Would it matter if there were 20 or 1,000
peasants to be saved? What if killing or torturing one innocent person
could save a city of 10 million persons from a terrorist's nuclear
device? At some point does not integrity become the ultimate egoism of
fastidious self-righteousness in which the purity of the self is more
important than the lives of countless others? Is it not better to follow
a consequentialist approach, admit remorse or regret over the immoral
means, but justify the actions by consequences? Do absolutist approaches
to integrity become self-contradictory in a world of nuclear weapons "Do
what is right though the world should perish" was a difficult principle
even when Kant expounded it in the eighteenth century, and there is some
evidence that he did not mean it to be taken literally even then. Now
that it may be literally possible in the Nuclear age, it seems more than
ever to be self-contradictory. Absolutist ethics bear a heaver burden of
proof in the nuclear age than ever before.

## Once an action enters the policy realm we must use a Consequentialist approach, this is necessary to minimize suffering and conflict. 

**Murray in 97**, Professor of Political Theory at the University of
Edinburgh, \[Alastair J. H., *Reconstructing Realism: between Power
Politics and Cosmopolitan Ethics*, p. 110\]

Weber emphasised that, while the \'absolute ethic of the gospel\' must
be taken seriously, it is inadequate to the tasks of evaluation
presented by politics. Against this \'ethic of ultimate ends\' ---
Gesinnung --- he therefore proposed the \'ethic of responsibility\' ---
Verantwortung. First, whilst the former dictates only the purity of
intentions and pays no attention to consequences, the ethic of
responsibility commands acknowledgement of the divergence between
intention and result. Its adherent \'does not feel in a position to
burden others with the results of his **[\[or her\]]{.smallcaps}** own
actions so far as he was able to foresee them; he will say: these
results are ascribed to my action\'. Second, the \'ethic of ultimate
ends\' is incapable of dealing adequately with the moral dilemma
presented by the necessity of using evil means to achieve moral
ends[:]{.underline} Everything that is striven for through political
action operating with violent means and following an ethic of
responsibility endangers the \'salvation of the soul.\' If, however, one
chases after the ultimate good in a war of beliefs, following a pure
ethic of absolute ends, then the goals may be changed and discredited
for generations, because responsibility for consequences is lacking. The
\'ethic of responsibility\', on the other hand, can accommodate this
paradox and limit the employment of such means, because it accepts
responsibility for the consequences which they imply. Thus, Weber
maintains that only the ethic of responsibility can cope with the
\'inner tension\' between the \'demon of politics\' and \'the god of
love\'. 9 The realists followed this conception closely in their
formulation of a political ethic.10 This influence is particularly clear
in Morgenthau.11 In terms of the first element of this conception, the
rejection of a purely deontological ethic, Morgenthau echoed Weber\'s
formulation, arguing that: the political actor has, beyond the general
moral duties, a special moral responsibility to act wisely \... The
individual[,]{.underline} acting on his own behalf, may act unwisely
without moral reproach as long as the consequences of his inexpedient
action concern only \[her or\] himself[.]{.underline} What is done in
the political sphere by its very nature concerns others who must suffer
from unwise action. What is here done with good intentions but unwisely
and hence with disastrous results is morally defective; for it violates
the ethics of responsibility to which all action affecting others, and
hence political action par excellence, is subject.12

## Utilitarianism and other forms of calculation are inevitable

**Stelzig**, Tom J.D. candidate at U PENN, **1998** (University of
Pennsylvania Law Review)

If the latter is true, no more need be said to show that deontological
norms do not exhaust morality. If the former is correct, because
[rights]{.underline} claims may be overridden only when substantially
more good will result - Thomason\'s Trade Off Idea n. 107 - then almost
ever situation will involve a true conflict of rights. Determining the
resolution of these rights-conflicts would require that morality be
supplemented with principles other than rights. If this is correct,
rights would perform relatively little theoretical work beyond
triggering these principles. Whatever principles would be regularly
invoked for resolving rights-conflicts would do the bulk of the work of
determining right action[.]{.underline} Such a notion does not sit well
with the claim that deontology exhausts morality, for the reason already
discussed.

## Individual and government choices on morality are different, once we play the role of policy makers we must follow a utilitarian calculus 

**Goodin**[,]{.underline} Fellow of philosophy at Austialian National
University, **1990** (Robert, The Utilitarian Response)

That, I submit is a fallacy. It does matter who is using the utilitarian
calculus, in what circumstance and for what propose. Using the felicific
calculus for micro-level purposes of guiding individuals choices of
personal conduct is altogether different from using it for macro-level
purposes of guiding public officials' choices of general social policy.
A different menu of option -- in some respects greater, in others, less,
but in any case different -- is available to public and private
choosers. Thos differences are such as to neutralized in the public
sphere, most of the objections standardly lodged against utilitarianism
in the private sphere. True though such complaints may be as applied to
utilitarianism as a standard of personal conduct they are irrelevant (or
anyway much less problematic) as applied to utilitarianism as a standard
of public policy. Or so I shall argue[.]{.underline}

Performance is the test. Asked directly by a Western interviewer, \"In
principle, do you believe in one standard of human rights and free
expression?\", Lee immediately answers, \"Look, it is not a matter of
principle but of practice.\" This might appear to represent a simple and
rather crude pragmatism. But in its context it might also be interpreted
as an appreciation of the fundamental point made by Max Weber that, in
politics, it is \"the ethic of responsibility\" rather than \"the ethic
of absolute ends\" that is appropriate. While an individual is free to
treat human rights as absolute, to be observed whatever the cost.
Governments must weigh consequences and the competing claims of other
ends. So once the enter the realm of politics, human rights have to take
their place in a hierarchy of interests, including such basic things as
national security and the promotion of prosperity.

**Johnson, 85** (Conrad D. Johnson, \'The Authority of the Moral
Agent\', Journal of Philosophy 82, No 8

(August 1985), pp. 391)

If we follow the usual deontological conception, there are also
well-known difficulties. If it is simply wrong to kill the innocent, the
wrongness must in some wav be connected to the
consequences[.]{.underline} That an innocent person is killed must be a
consequence that has some important bearing on the wrongness of the
action; else why be so concerned about the killing of an innocent?
Further, if it is wrong in certain cases for the agent to weigh the
consequences in deciding whether to kill or to break a promise, it is
hard to deny that this has some connection to the
consequences[.]{.underline} Following one line of thought[,]{.underline}
it is consequentialist considerations of mistrust that stand behind such
restrictions on what the agent may take into account[.]{.underline}3 But
then again it is hard to deal with that rare case in which the agent can
truly claim that his judgement about the consequences is accurate, or,
in that last resort of the philosophical thought experiment, has been
verified by the Infallible Optimizer.

## Ignoring consequences is immoral - they sacrifice others to preserve moral purity.

Ailinsky 1971 (Saul D., Activist, Prof, Social Organizer with Int\'l
Fame, Founder of Industrial Areas Foundation, Rules for Radicals, p.
24-7)

\"Does this particular end justify this particular means?\" Life and how
you live it is the story of means and ends. The end is what you want,
and the means is how you get it. Whenever we think about social change,
the question of means and ends arises. The person \[man\] of action
views the issue of means and ends in pragmatic and strategic terms. He
has no other problem; he thinks only of his actual resources and the
possibilities of various choices of action. He asks of ends only whether
they are achievable and worth the cost; of means, only whether they will
work. To say that corrupt means corrupt the ends is to believe in the
immaculate conception of ends and principles. The real arena is corrupt
and bloody. Life is a corrupting process from the time a child learns to
play his mother off against his father in the politics of when to go to
bed; he who fears corruption fears life. The practical revolutionary
will understand Geothe\'s [\"]{.underline}conscience is the virtue of
observers and not of agents of action in action one does not always
enjoy the luxury of a decision that is consistent both with one s
individual conscience and the good of \[humankind. The choice must
always be for the latter. Action is for mass salvation and not for the
individual\'s personal salvation. He \[or she1 who sacrifices the mass
good for his personal conscience has peculiar conception of \"personal
salvation\"; he doesn\'t care enough for people to be \"corrupted\" for
them. The people \[men\] who pile up the heaps of discussion and
literature on the ethics of means and ends-which with rare exception is
conspicuous for its sterility-rarely write about their won experiences
in the perpetual struggle of life and change. They are strangers,
moreover, to the burdens and problems of operational responsibility and
the unceasing pressure for immediate decisions. They are passionately
committed to a mystical objectivity where passions are suspect. They
assume a nonexistent situation where men dispassionately and with reason
draw and devise means and ends as if studying a navigational chart on
land. They can be recognized by one of two verbal brands; \"We agree
with the ends but not the means,\" or \"This is not the time.\" The
means-and- end moralists or non-doers always wind up on their ends
without any means. The means-and- \'ends moralists, constantly obsessed
with the ethics of the means used by the Have-Nots against the Haves,
should search themselves as to their real political position. In fact,
they are passive-but real-allies of the Haves. They are the ones Jacques
Maritain referred to in his statement, \"The fear of soiling ourselves
by entering the context of history is not virtue, but a way of escaping
virtue.\" These non-doers were the ones who chose not to fight the Nazis
in the only way they could have been fought; they were the ones who drew
their window blinds to shut out the shameful spectacle of Jews and
political prisoners being dragged through the streets; they were the
ones who privately deplored the horror of it all-and did nothing. This
is the nadir of immorality. The most unethical of all means is the
nonuse of any means[.]{.underline} It is this species of man who so
vehemently and militantly participated in that classically idealistic
debate at the old League of Nations on the ethical differences between
defensive and offensive weapons. Their fears of action drive them to
refuge in an ethics so divorced from the politics of life that it can
apply only to angels, not to men. The standards ofjudgment must be
rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived, the world as
it is, not our wished-for fantasy of the world as it should be. 1
present here a series of rules pertaining to the ethics of means and
ends: first, that one\'s concern with the ethics of means and ends
varies inversely with one\'s personal interest in the issue. When we are
not directly concerned our morality overflows; as La Rochefoucauld put
it, \"We all have strength enough to endure the misfortunes of others.\"

## Justice -- must save humanity and weigh {#justice-must-save-humanity-and-weigh .Tags}

Sissela **Bok**, Professor of Philosophy, Brandeis, Applied Ethics and
Ethical Theory, Ed. David Rosenthal and Fudlou Shehadi, 19**88**

The same argument can be made for Kant\'s other formulations of the
Categorical Imperative: \"So act as to use humanity, both in your own
person and in the person of every other, always at the same time as an
end, never simply as a means\"; and \"So act as if you were always
through actions a law-making member in a universal Kingdom of Ends.\" No
one with a concern for humanity could consistently will to risk
eliminating humanity in the person of himself and every other or to risk
the death of all members in a universal Kingdom of Ends for the sake of
justice. To risk their collective death for the sake of following one\'s
conscience would be, as Rawls said, \"irrational, crazy.\" And to say
that one did not intend such a catastrophe, but that one merely failed
to stop other persons from bringing it about would be beside the point
when the end of the world was at stake, For although it is true that we
cannot be held responsible for most of the wrongs that others commit,
the Latin maxim presents a case where we would have to take such a
responsibility seriously - perhaps to the point of deceiving, bribing,
even killing an innocent person, in order that the world not perish.

## Utilitarian actions only act as a last resort. Lack of alternatives means the only inhuman action is to not act at all.  {#utilitarian-actions-only-act-as-a-last-resort.-lack-of-alternatives-means-the-only-inhuman-action-is-to-not-act-at-all. .Tags}

Forget the levity of the example and consider the case of the innocent
fat man. [If there really is no other way of unsticking our fat man and
if plainly, without blasting him out, everyone in the cave will drown,
then, innocent or not, he should be blasted out]{.underline}. This
indeed overrides the principle that the innocent should never be
deliberately killed, but it does not reveal a callousness toward life,
for the people involved are caught in a desperate situation in which, if
such extreme action is not taken, many lives will be lost and far
greater misery will obtain. [Moreover, the people who do such a horrible
thing or acquiesce in the doing of it are not likely to be rendered more
callous about human life and human suffering as a result]{.underline}.
Its occurrence will haunt them for the rest of their lives and is as
likely as not to make them more rather than less morally sensitive. It
[is not even correct to say that such a desperate act shows a lack of
respect for persons]{.underline}. [We are not treating the fat man
merely as a means. The fat man\'s person-his interests and rights-are
not ignored. Killing him is something which is undertaken with the
greatest reluctance. It is only when it is quite certain that there is
no other way to save the lives of the others that such a violent course
of action is justifiably undertaken]{.underline}**.** Alan Donagan,
[arguing rather]{.underline} as Anscombe argues, maintains that \"[to
use any innocent man ill for the sake of some public good is directly to
degrade him to being a mere means\" and to do this is of course to
violate a principle essential to morality]{.underline}, that is, that
human beings should never merely be treated as means but should be
treated as ends in themselves (as persons worthy of respect).l1 But, as
my above remarks show, [it need not be the case, and in the above
situation it is not the case, that in killing such an innocent man we
are treating him merely as a means. The action is universalizable, all
alternative actions which would save his life are duly considered, the
blasting out is done only as a last and desperate resort with the
minimum of harshness and indifference to his suffering and the
like.]{.underline} It indeed sounds ironical to talk this way, given
what is done to him. But if such a terrible situation were to arise,
there would always be more or less humane ways of going about one\'s
grim task. [And in acting in the more humane ways toward the fat man, as
we do what we must do and would have done to ourselves were the roles
reversed, we show a respect for his person]{.underline}.12 [In so
treating the fat man-not just to further the public good but to prevent
the certain death of a whole group of people]{.underline} (that is to
prevent an even greater evil than his being killed in this way}-[the
claims of justice are not overriden either, for each individual
involved, if he is reasonably correct, should realize that if he were so
stuck rather than the fat man, he should in such situations be blasted
out]{.underline}. [Thus, there is no question of being
unfair]{.underline}**.** Surely we must choose between evils here, but
is there anything more reasonable, more morally appropriate, than
choosing the lesser evil when doing or allowing some evil cannot be
avoided? That is, where there is no avoiding both and where our actions
can determine whether a greater or lesser evil obtains, should we not
plainly always opt for the lesser evil? And [is it not obviously a
greater evil that all those other innocent people should suffer and die
than that the fat man should suffer and die]{.underline}? Blowing up the
fat man is indeed monstrous. But [letting him remain stuck while the
whole group drowns is still more monstrous]{.underline}.

## Overriding rights is justified when more rights of others and lives are at stake.  {#overriding-rights-is-justified-when-more-rights-of-others-and-lives-are-at-stake. .Tags}

One can even think, against utilitarianism, that any substantive outcome
achieved by morally proper procedure is morally right and hence
acceptable (so long as rights are not in play). The main point, however,
is that [utilitarianism has a necessary pace in any democratic
country\'s normal political deliberations.]{.underline} But its
advocates must know its place, which ordinarily is only to help to
decide what the theory of rights leaves alone. When may rights be
overridden by government? I have two sorts of cases in mind: [overriding
a particular right of some persons for the sake of preserving the same
right of others, and overriding the same right of everyone for the sake
of what I will clumsily call \"civilization values.\"]{.underline} An
advocate of rights could countenance, perhaps must countenance, the
state\'s overriding of rights for these two reasons. The subject is
painful and liable to dispute every step of the way. For the state to
override-that is, sacrifice---a right of some so that others may keep
it. [The situation must be desperate]{.underline}. I have in mind, say,
[circumstances in which the choice is between sacrificing a right of
some and letting a right of all be lost. The state]{.underline} (or some
other agent) [may kill some (or allow them to he killed), if the only
alternative is letting every-one die**.**]{.underline} It is the right
to life which most prominently figures in thinking about desperate
situations[. I cannot see any resolution but to heed the precept that
\"numbers count.\"]{.underline} Just as one may prefer saving one\'s own
life to saving that of another when both cannot be saved, so a third
parry---let us say, the state---can (perhaps must) choose to save the
greater number of lives and at the cost of the lesser number, when there
is otherwise no hope for either group. That choice does not mean that
those to be sacrificed are immoral if they resist being sacrificed. It
follows, of course, that if a third party is right to risk or sacrifice
the lives of the lesser for the lives of the lesser for the lives of the
greater number when the lesser would otherwise live, the lesser are also
not wrong if they resist being sacrificed.

## We must choose the lesser evil. Hard and fast rules about what is right must be made to limit further atrocities against civilization {#we-must-choose-the-lesser-evil.-hard-and-fast-rules-about-what-is-right-must-be-made-to-limit-further-atrocities-against-civilization .Tags}

WHAT WOULD IT mean for the American left right now to take seriously the
centrality of means in politics? First, it would mean taking seriously
the specific means employed by the September 11 attackers\--terrorism[.
There is a tendency in some quarters of the left to assimilate the death
and destruction of September 11 to more ordinary]{.underline} (and still
deplorable) [injustices of the world system]{.underline}\--the
starvation of children in Africa, or the repression of peasants in
Mexico, or the continued occupation of the West Bank and Gaza by Israel.
[But this assimilation is only possible by ignoring the specific
modalities of September 11. It is true that in Mexico, Palestine, and
elsewhere, too many innocent people suffer, and that is
wrong]{.underline}. It may even be true that the experience of suffering
is equally terrible in each case. [But neither the Mexican nor the
Israeli government has ever hijacked civilian airliners and deliberately
flown them into crowded office buildings in the middle of cities where
innocent civilians work and live, with the intention of killing
thousands of people. Al-Qaeda did precisely this. That does not make the
other injustices unimportant. It simply makes them
different.]{.underline} It makes the September 11 hijackings
distinctive, in their defining and malevolent purpose\--to kill people
and to create terror and havoc. [This was not an ordinary injustice. It
was an extraordinary injustice. The premise of terrorism is the sheer
superfluousness of human life.]{.underline} This premise is inconsistent
with civilized living anywhere. It threatens people of every race and
class, every ethnicity and religion. [Because it threatens everyone, and
threatens values central to any decent conception of a good society, it
must be fought]{.underline}. And it must be fought in a way commensurate
with its malevolence. [Ordinary injustice can be remedied. Terrorism can
only be stopped]{.underline}. Second, it would mean frankly
acknowledging something well understood, often too eagerly embraced, by
the twentieth century Marxist left\--that [it is often politically
necessary to employ morally troubling means in the name of morally valid
ends]{.underline}. A just or even a better society can only be realized
in and through political practice; in our complex and bloody world, it
will sometimes be necessary to respond to barbarous tyrants or
criminals, with whom moral suasion won\'t work[. In such situations our
choice is not between the wrong that confronts us and our ideal vision
of a world beyond wrong. It is between the wrong that confronts us and
the means\--perhaps the dangerous means\--we have to employ in order to
oppose it]{.underline}. [In such situations there is a danger that
\"realism\" can become a rationale for the Machiavellian worship of
power]{.underline}. But [equally great is the danger of a righteousness
that translates, in effect, into a refusal to act in the face of
wrong.]{.underline} What is one to do? Proceed with caution. Avoid
casting oneself as the incarnation of pure goodness locked in a
Manichean struggle with evil. Be wary of violence. Look for alternative
means when they are available, and support the development of such means
when they are not. And never sacrifice democratic freedoms and open
debate. Above all, ask the hard questions about the situation at hand,
the means available, and the likely effectiveness of different
strategies.

## Moral policy only blocks decision making necessary to limit further damage. Injustice can only be destroyed by inaction to make sacrifices {#moral-policy-only-blocks-decision-making-necessary-to-limit-further-damage.-injustice-can-only-be-destroyed-by-inaction-to-make-sacrifices .Tags}

As a result, the most important political questions are simply not
asked. [It is assumed that U.S. military intervention is an act of
\"aggression,\" but no consideration is given to the aggression to which
intervention is a response]{.underline}. [The status quo ante in
Afghanistan is not, as peace activists would have it, peace, but rather
terrorist violence abetted by a regime\--the Taliban\--that rose to
power through brutality and repression]{.underline}. This requires us to
ask a question that most \"peace\" activists would prefer not to ask:
[What should be done to respond to the violence of a Saddam Hussein, or
a Milosevic, or a Taliban regime?]{.underline} What means are likely to
stop violence and bring criminals to justice? [Calls for diplomacy and
international law are well intended and important; they implicate a
decent and civilized ethic of global order. But they are also vague and
empty, because they are not accompanied by any account of how diplomacy
or international law can work effectively to address the problem at
hand]{.underline}. The campus left offers no such account. [To do so
would require it to contemplate tragic choices in which moral goodness
is of limited utility.]{.underline} Here what matters is not purity of
intention but the intelligent exercise of power.

Power is not a dirty word or an unfortunate feature of the world. It is
the core of politics. Power is the ability to effect outcomes in the
world. [Politics, in large part, involves contests over the distribution
and use of power. To accomplish anything in the political world, one
must attend to the means that are necessary to bring it
about]{.underline}. And to develop such means is to develop, and to
exercise, power. [To say this is not to say that power is beyond
morality. It is to say that power is not reducible to
morality]{.underline}. As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max
Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and Hannah Arendt have taught, [an unyielding
concern with moral goodness undercuts political
responsibility.]{.underline} The concern may be morally laudable,
reflecting a kind of personal integrity, but it suffers from three fatal
flaws: (1) It fails to see that the purity of one\'s intention does not
ensure the achievement of what one intends. [Abjuring violence or
refusing to make common cause with morally compromised parties may seem
like the right thing; but if such tactics entail impotence, then it is
hard to view them as serving any moral good beyond the clean conscience
of their supporters;]{.underline} (2[) it fails to see that in a world
of real violence and injustice, moral purity is not simply a form of
powerlessness; it is often a form of complicity in
injustice]{.underline}. This is why, [from the standpoint of
politics\--as opposed to religion\--pacifism is always a potentially
immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in
principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect;
and]{.underline} (3) [it fails to see that politics is as much about
unintended consequences as it is about intentions; it is the effects of
action, rather than the motives of action, that is most
significant.]{.underline} Just as the alignment with \"good\" may
engender impotence, it is often the pursuit of \"good\" that generates
evil. This is the lesson of communism in the twentieth century: it is
not enough that one\'s goals be sincere or idealistic[; it is equally
important, always, to ask about the effects of pursuing these goals and
to judge these effects in pragmatic and historically contextualized
ways. Moral absolutism inhibits this judgment. It alienates those who
are not true believers. It promotes arrogance. And it undermines
political effectiveness.]{.underline}

The significance and the limits of the two broad traditions can be
captured by contemplating a hypothetical case.34 [Imagine]{.underline}
that you are visiting a Central American country and you happen upon a
village square where [an army captain is about to order his men to shoot
two peasants lined up against a wall.]{.underline} When you ask the
reason, you are told someone in this village shot at the captain\'s men
last night. When you object to the killing of possibly innocent people,
you are told that civil wars do not permit moral niceties. Just to prove
the point that we all have dirty hands in such situations, the captain
hands you a rifle [and tells you that if you will shoot one peasant, he
will free the other.]{.underline} Otherwise both die. He warns you not
to try any tricks because his men have their guns trained on you. [Will
you shoot one person with the consequences of saving one, or will you
allow both to die but preserve your moral integrity by refusing to play
his dirty game? The point]{.underline} of the story [is to show the
value and limits of both traditions. Integrity is clearly an important
value, and many of us would refuse to shoot. But at what point does the
principle of not taking an innocent life collapse before the
consequentialist burden?]{.underline} Would it matter if there were
twenty or 1,000 peasants to be saved? [What if killing or torturing one
innocent person could save a city of 10 million persons from a
terrorists\' nuclear device?]{.underline} At some point does not
integrity become the ultimate egoism of fastidious self-righteousness in
which the purity of the self is more important than the lives of
countless others[? Is it not better to follow a consequentialist
approach, admit remorse or regret over the immoral means, but justify
the action by the consequences?]{.underline} Do absolutist approaches to
integrity become self-contradictory in a world of nuclear weapons? \"Do
what is right though the world should perish\" was a difficult principle
even when Kant expounded it in the eighteenth century, and there is some
evidence that he did not mean it to be taken literally even then. [Now
that it may be literally possible in the nuclear age, it seems more than
ever to be self-contradictory.35 Absolutist ethics bear a heavier burden
of proof in the nuclear age than ever before.]{.underline}

observed whatever the cost, governments must always weigh consequences
and the competing claims of other ends]{.underline}. So once they enter
the realm of politics, [human rights have to take their place in a
hierarchy of interests]{.underline}, including such basic things as
national security and the promotion of prosperity. [Their
place]{.underline} in that hierarchy [will vary with circumstances, but
no responsible government will ever be able to put them always at the
top and treat them as inviolable and over-riding. The cost of
implementing and promoting them will always have to be
considered.]{.underline} Lee\'s answer might also be compared to Edmund
Burke\'s conclusions on how England should govern its colonies, as
expressed in his Letter to the Sheriffs of the City of Bristol in 1777:
\|I\~t was our duty, in all soberness, to conform our government to the
character and circumstances of the several people who composed this
mighty and strangely diversified mass. [I never was wild enough to
conceive that one method would serve for the whole, that the natives of
Hindostan and those of Virginia could be ordered in the same manner, or
that the Cutchery court and the grand jury of Salem could be regulated
on a similar plan. I was persuaded that government was a practical thing
made for the happiness of mankind, and not to furnish out a spectacle of
uniformity to gratify the schemes of visionary politicians.]{.underline}

[A consequentialist moral theory can take account of this variance and
direct us in our decision about whether a plausible right to equality
ought to outweigh a plausible right to freedom of
expression]{.underline}. 16 In some circumstances the effects of
pornography would surely be malign enough to justify our banning it, but
in others they may be not malign enough to justify any interference in
freedom. I? [A deontological theory, in contrast, would be required
either to rank the side constraints, which forbid agents from
interfering in the free expression of others and from impairing the
moral equality of others, or to admit defeat and claim that no
adjudication between the two rights is possible. The latter admission is
a grave failure since it would leave us no principled resolution of a
serious policy question]{.underline}. But the former conclusion is
hardly attractive either. Would we really wish to establish as true for
all times and circumstances a lexical ordering between two side
constraints on our actions without careful attention to consequences?
Would we, for instance, really wish to establish that the slightest
malign inegalitarian effect traceable to a form of expression is
adequate grounds for an intrusive and costly censorship? Or would we,
alternatively, really wish to establish that we should be prepared to
tolerate a society horrible for women and children to live in, for the
sake of not allowing any infringement on the sacred right of free
expression?18 [Consequentialist accounts can avoid such a deontological
dilemma. In so doing, they show a certain healthy sense of realism about
what life in society is like. In the world outside the theorist\'s
study, we meet trade-offs at every tum. Every policy we make with some
worthy end in Sight imposes costs in terms of diminished achievement of
some other plausibly worthy end. Consequentialism demands that we
grapple with these costs as directly as we can and justify their
incurrence. It forbids us to dismiss them with moral sophistries or to
ignore them as if we lived in an ideal world.]{.underline}

Let us say that a society of rights-based individualism encourages these
and other crepuscular activities to become topics for open and popular
discussion; [that that fact can be taken as a paradoxical sign of the
moral grandness of such a society, for practically every desire can be
honestly admitted and talked about despite shame or without shame; that
a society devoted to rights has no absolutely compelling
arguments]{.underline}, in every case, to prohibit them and that,
nevertheless, civilization (democratic or not) so we are trained to
understand it commits us to continue to condemn and prohibit them. The
issue must be raised in dismay, and I am not able to deal with it
adequately. Can rights conflict? [It is not agreeable to admit that a
particular right of one person may]{.underline} apparently [conflict
with]{.underline} a different right of [someone else]{.underline}.
[Familiar antagonisms include that between the rights to a fair trial
unprejudiced by excessive publicity and the right of press to report a
story and its background fully, or that between the right to privacy
again, the right of the press to do what it thinks is its work. Though I
believe, as I have said, that some rights]{.underline} (including
freedom of the press) [are more fundamental than others, in some
conflicts no clear priority is likely to be established and only ad hoc
adjustments are desirable. To be sure, although these conflicts may be
less frequent or stark than is claimed by those who are impatient with
the rights in question, conflicts nevertheless take place]{.underline}.
This is a fact of life which no appeal to an elaborated theory of rights
can eliminate. If it is a shortcoming in the theory of rights, it is
also a shortcoming that no supplementary principle such as
utilitarianism can make good.

[We can say in regard to the relevant examples that no one has the right
to enslave or mutilate or ritually kill another, even with the other's
permission]{.underline}. There is no right to accept another's
renunciation of a right. [One cannot cooperate with or take advantage of
another person's abdication of humanity]{.underline}. We can also say,
for other activities, that one has no right to use one's freedom to
abandon it altogether (as with drug addiction) or alienate it (as with
voluntary slavery), for freedom is meaningless when it becomes the
instrument of bondage. [All these arguments]{.underline} are true but
[do not reach the deepest level of objection, for all these activities
arouse deep and wide spread disgust and revulsion. To be guided by these
feelings, however, is risky because many activities once thought
disgusting and horrible are now allowed and sometimes welcomed and
celebrated, at least in some democratic societies. Also, we cannot say
that the feelings hostile to these activities are instinctual; though
common, such feelings are culturally deposited]{.underline}. I can
understand the wish to say that these activities injure the human
dignity of people who do them. It can be argued that the injury results
not merely because (in some cases) they are renouncing a right and (in
other cases) using their rights in ways never contemplated by advocates
of rights. [Rather, these free or consensual activities degrade people
who do them below the level of decent humanity. The practitioners
forfeit respect: that is the reason they must be controlled. I do not
think, however, that I can follow this line because I do not associate
human dignity with any teleology or reason for being, or even with a
more bounded perfectionism]{.underline}**.** As I understand [the theory
of rights-based individualism, it disallows universal and enforceable
answers to the questions, Why do we live? What is the point of living? I
am therefore reluctant to rest a case for control on the notion of human
dignity itself.]{.underline}

My larger argument turns on the proposition that [there is something
special about the situation of public officials that makes
utilitarianism more plausible for them]{.underline} (or, more precisely,
makes them adopt a form of utilitarianism that we would find more
acceptable) than private individuals. Before proceeding with that larger
argument, I must therefore say what it is that is so special about
public officials and [their situations that makes it both more
necessary]{.underline} and more desirable [for them to adopt a more
credible form of utilitarianism.]{.underline} Consider, first the
argument from necessity. [Public officials are obliged to make their
choices under uncertainty]{.underline}, and uncertainty of a very
special sort at that. All choices-public and private alike- are made
under some degree of uncertainty, of course. But in the nature of
things[, private individuals will usually have more complete information
on the peculiarities of their own circumstances and on the ramifications
that alternative possible choices might have for them.]{.underline}
[Public officials, in contrast, at relatively poorly informed as to the
effects that their choices will have on individuals, one by one. What
they typically do know are generalities: averages and aggregates. They
know what will happen most often to most people as a result of their
various possible choices. But that is all.]{.underline} [That is enough
to allow public policy makers to use the utilitarian
calculus]{.underline} -- if they want to use it at all -- to choose
general rules of conduct. Knowing aggregates and averages, they can
proceed to calculate the utility payoffs from adopting each alternative
possible general rule. But [they cannot be sure what the payoff will be
to any given individual or on any particular occasion. Their knowledge
of generalities, aggregates and averages is just not sufficiently
fine-grained for that.]{.underline}

## Not knowing conditions for each individual or ramifications forces us to adopt utilitarianism. Policy makers must use in their decision making {#not-knowing-conditions-for-each-individual-or-ramifications-forces-us-to-adopt-utilitarianism.-policy-makers-must-use-in-their-decision-making .Tags}

Goodin 95 -- Professor of Philosophy at the Research School of the

Furthermore, the argument from necessity would continue, [the
instruments available to public policy-makers are relatively
blunt.]{.underline} They can influence general tendencies, making rather
more people behave in certain sorts of ways rather more often. But
perfect compliance is unrealistic. And (building on the previous point)
[not knowing particular circumstances of particular individuals, rules
and regulations must necessarily be relatively general in form. They
must treat more people more nearly alike than ideally they should, had
we perfect information. The combined effect of these two factors is to
preclude public policy-makers from fine-tuning policies very well at
all. They must, of necessity, deal with people in aggregate, imposing
upon them rules that are general in form. Nothing in any of this
necessarily forces them to be utilitarian in their public policy-making,
of course. What it does do, however, is force them- if they are inclined
to be utilitarian at all-away from direct (act) utilitarianism. The
circumstances surrounding the selection and implementation of public
policies simply do not permit the more precise calculations required by
any decision rule more tailored to peculiarities of individuals or
situations.]{.underline}

[The liberal conception of equality sharply limits the extent to which
ideal arguments of policy may be used to justify any constraint on
liberty]{.underline}. Such arguments cannot be used if the idea in
question is itself controversial within the community. [Constraints
cannot be defended]{.underline}, for example, [directly on the ground
that they contribute to a culturally sophisticated
community]{.underline}, whether the community wants the sophistication
or not, [because that argument would violate the canon of the liberal
conception of equality that prohibits a government from relying on the
claim that certain forms of life are inherently more valuable than
others]{.underline}. [Utilitarian argument of policy, however, would
seem secure from that objection. They do not suppose that any form of
life is inherently more valuable than any other,]{.underline} but
instead base· their claim, [that constraints on liberty are necessary to
advance some collective goal of the community, just on the fact that
that goal happens to be desired more widely or more deeply]{.underline}
than any other. [Utilitarian arguments of]{.underline} policy,
therefore, [seem not to oppose but on the contrary to embody the
fundamental right of equal concern and respect, because they treat the
wishes of each member of the community on a par with the wishes of any
other, with no bonus or discount reflecting the view that that member is
more or less worthy of concern, or his views more or less worthy of
respect, than any other]{.underline}. This appearance of egalitarianism
has, I think, been the principal source of the great appeal that
utilitarianism has had, as a general political philosophy, over the last
century. In Chapter 9, however, I pointed out that the egalitarian
character of a utilitarian argument is often an illusion. I will not
repeat, but only summarize, my argument here. [Utilitarian arguments fix
on the fact that a particular constraint on liberty will make more
people happier, or satisfy more of their preferences, depending upon
whether psychological or preference utilitarianism is in
play]{.underline}. But people\'s overall preference for one policy
rather than another may be seen to include, on further analysis, both
preference that are personal, because they state a preference for the
assignment of one set of goods or opportunities to him and preferences
that are external, because they state a preference for one assignment of
goods or opportunities to others. But [a utilitarian argument that
assigns critical weight to the external preferences of members of the
community will not be egalitarian in the sense under consideration. It
will not respect the right of everyone to be treated with equal concern
and respect.]{.underline}

Rand has spoken of the ultimate end as the standard by which all other
ends are evaluated. When the ends to be evaluated are chosen ones the
ultimate end is the standard for moral evaluation. Life as the sort of
thing a living entity is, then, is the ultimate standard of value; and
since only human beings are capable of choosing their ends, it is the
life as a human being-man\'s life qua man-that is the standard for moral
evaluation.

Why should this be the standard for moral evaluation? Why must this be
the ultimate moral value? Why not \"death\" or \"the greatest happiness
for the greatest number\"? Man\'s life must be the standard for judging
moral value because this is the end toward which all goal-directed
action (in this case purposive action) is directed, and we have already
shown why goal-directed behavior depends on life. Indeed, one cannot
make a choice without implicitly choosing life as the end.

In so far as one chooses, regardless of the choice, one choose (value)
man\'s life. It makes no sense to value some X without also valuing that
which makes the valuing of X possible \~:notice that this is different
from saying \"that which makes X possible\"). If one lets X be
equivalent to \"death\" or \"the greatest happiness for the greatest
number,\" one is able to have such a valuation only because of the
precondition of being a living being. Given that life is a necessary
condition for valuation, there is no other way we can value something
without also (implicitly at least) valuing that which makes valuation
possible.

In spite of this, Bentham\'s clear apprehension of utilitarianism\'s
commitment to rejecting the view that there are certain basic natural
human moral rights that hold of human beings as human beings[, very many
utilitarians today seek to reconcile their utilitarianism with theories
of human moral rights, with theories of natural moral rights of
persons]{.underline} of the kinds set out in the UN Declarations,
according to which we are claimed to possess various basic, fundamental
moral rights simply by virtue of being human beings, or human persons,
and not by virtue of the utility of a belief in and action on the basis
of respect for such rights. [Utilitarianism denies, and is committed to
denying, that there are natural moral rights that hold of persons as
persons, of human beings *qua* human beings. If its ethic is to be
expressed in the language of moral rights, it might be said to hold that
it is the greatest good or the greatest */*pleasure that has a moral
right to exist, that individual persons and animals have no moral right
to a specific share in or of the greatest good, I their roles being
those of being instruments for achieving or vehicles for bringing into
being and sustaining the greatest good, they having a moral right to
contribute to the common good as vehicles or instruments
thereof.]{.underline} Of course, strictly speaking, an abstraction such
as [the greatest good cannot in any literal sense of \'moral right,\'
possess moral rights, whilst the rights individuals may possess as
vehicles or instruments of the greatest good would be a mixed bunch,
including such rights as the rights to live or to be killed, to be free
or to be constrained, to be helped or to be harmed or used-the rights
varying from person to person, situation to situation, from time to
lime.]{.underline} Thus, [if the greatest good could be realized by
promoting the pleasure of only one or other of two distinct groups of
one hundred persons, then, in terms of utilitarianism, **it would
morally be indifferent which group was chosen**, and no member of either
group would have a moral right to the pleasure.]{.underline} Similarly,
if, in a war, the greatest good could be achieved only be sending a
particular platoon on a suicide mission, the officer in charge would
have the moral right to order the platoon to go on the mission, and the
members of the platoon would have the moral right to be killed for the
sake of the greatest good. This is a very different way of thinking
about moral rights from that in terms of there being certain basic human
moral rights.

[A utilitarian might seek to accommodate talk about human moral rights
within the utilitarian framework by arguing that there are good
utilitarian reasons for attributing human rights to persons who do not
possess moral rights, just as there may be good utilitarian reasons for
ascribing responsibility to persons who are not morally responsible for
their actions. This might be urged in terms of act-utilitarianism as a
tactical move for maximizing good.]{.underline} Alternatively, it could
be developed as an element of a rule-utilitarianism. **[Clearly it would
be difficult to find plausible act-utilitarian reasons for propagating
such a falsehood]{.underline}**. On the other hand, whilst a
rule-utilitarianism that incorporated such a human moral rights
component would normatively be more attractive than many versions of
rule-utilitarianism, it would remain exposed to the basic criticisms of
rule-utilitarianism set out by JJ. C. Smart, myself, and others.\'

Because evolutionary utilitarianism is concerned with human survival and
depends on human response, its goal is necessarily fulfillment of human
needs and wants. Utilitarian choices are made by existing humans. The
decisions of every human are derived from the experience, and reflect
the desires, of that human. Humans may be concerned with the needs and

[Problems of a different kind are encountered by the claim that certain
negative rights]{.underline}, for example, the right to life interpreted
as a right not to be killed, [are always absolute, namely, that such a
claim leads to morally unacceptable conclusions. Different rights, for
example, the rights to life and to moral autonomy and integrity, may
conflict with one another, such that we have morally to determine which
to respect and in what way; the one right, such as the right to life,
may give rise to conflicts, such that we can protect, save one life,
only by sacrificing or not saving another life. **And rights may
conflict with other values**, such as pleasure or pain, in ways that
morally oblige us to qualify our respect for the right]{.underline}, as
in curtailing acts directed at a persons\' self-development to prevent
gross cruelty to animals. Thomists have offered partial, but only
partial, replies to criticisms based on these difficulties in terms of
theories such as the Doctrine of Double Effect, the theory of the Unjust
Aggressor (who may be neither unjust nor morally responsible for what he
does). However these replies themselves encounter difficulties of many

conclusions not unlike those to which they object when such I

Thus the Doctrine of Double Effect permits the knowing, unintentional

good; yet it commits its exponents to losing a just war if success can
be achieved, and millions of innocent lives be saved, only by the
intentional killing of one innocent person. Similarly [objectionable
conclusions follow about the permissibility of killing morally innocent
\'unjust aggressors\' to save one\'s life. At the same time, acceptance
of these supporting theories amounts to an admission that human rights
such as the right to life are not always absolute. How can it be so if
we are said to have the moral right intentionally to kill the morally
innocent unjust aggressor, and knowingly, albeit unintentionally, to
kill innocent persons, when and if the intended good is proportionately
good, and cannot be achieved without bringing about the unintended,
foreseen good?]{.underline}

[A similar distinction needs to be drawn and a similar terminology is

considerations.]{.underline} The introduction of this distinction into
human moral rights theory is both right and necessary. It does however
greatly complicate the problem of determining what are the absolute,
morally operative rights of a person in any concrete situation[. Yet the
acknowledgment of this feature of basic human rights is necessary for
two reasons,]{.underline} the one because (physical resources may be

Is such acceptance likely? Consider the important example of the
adherents of utilitarian reasonable comprehensive doctrines[. Would a
utilitarian be able to endorse a Kantian conception of free persons,
with its elevation of rationality over the satisfaction of
desire]{.underline} and its consequent implications for agent motivation
in the Original Position? It seems unlikely that any utilitarian (with
the possible exception of John Stuart Mill in his most syncretic mood)
would countenance this variety of asceticism. Thus, [utilitarians would
be likely to focus on another interpretation of the idea of free persons
or perhaps on an entirely different fundamental idea or set of ideas;
doing so would lead them to structure the Original Position differently
and would presumably produce a political conception of justice that did
not include the Priority of Liberty. Rawls argues in Political
Liberalism that classical utilitarians]{.underline} (such as Jeremy
Bentham and Henry Sidgwick) [would be likely to endorse a "political
conception of justice liberal in content," but he never suggests that
they would choose the Priority of Liberty, or Justice as Fairness more
generally]{.underline} (PL, p. 170). [We can conclude from this finding
that the class of liberal political conceptions of justice constituting
the focus of a realistic overlapping consensus]{.underline} would
include conceptions that did not endorse the Priority of Liberty
(although they would all give the basic liberties "special priority").
Moreover, [Justice as Fairness might not be alone among the liberal
conceptions in endorsing the Priority of Liberty]{.underline}: a
reasonable comprehensive doctrine might, for example, support a Kantian
conception of free persons but not Rawls's particular interpretation of
society as a "fair system of cooperation," leading through the
procedures of political constructivism to a liberal conception of
justice that endorsed the Priority of Liberty but rejected, say, the
Difference Principle. Thus, [the Priority of Liberty would be one
competitor idea among many in an overlapping consensus, endorsed by both
adherents of Kantian comprehensive doctrines and their fellow travelers,
but rejected by others.]{.underline}

independently; it may, instead, figure as a subordinate clause wherein
the attribution of rights to the subject is only conditional. In all
cases. however, there is assumed some reason or ground that is held, at
least tentatively, to justify that attribution. This reason may, but
need not, be some moral or legal code[. In the present
case]{.underline}, [**where what is at issue is the justification of a
moral principle, such a principle cannot,** of course, **be adduced as
constituting the justifying ground for the attribution of the generic
rights to the agent.** Rather, in his statement making this attribution,
the justifying reason of the generic rights as viewed by the agent is
the fact that freedom and well-being are the most general and proximate
necessary conditions of all his purpose- fulfilling actions, so that
without his having these conditions his engaging in purposive action
would be futile or impossible]{.underline}. Because of this necessity,
[the agent who is the subject of the generic rights is assumed to set
forth or uphold the rights-judgment himself, as knowing what conditions
must be fulfilled if he is to be a purposive agent; and he upholds the
judgment not merely conditionally or tentatively but in an unqualified
way.]{.underline}

Robert Goodin, fellow Philosophy, Australian National Defense U, 1990,
*The Utilitarian Response,* p. 148

My main argument, though, is that at the level of social policy the
problem usually does not even arise. When promulgating policies, public
officials must respond to typical conditions and common circumstances.
Policies, by their nature, cannot be case- by-case affairs. In choosing
general rules ot govern a wide range of circumstances, it is
extraordinarily unlikely that the greatest happiness can ever be
realized by systematically violating people's rights. Liberties or
integrity -- or even, come to that, by systematically contravening the
Ten Commandments. The rules that maximize utility over the long haul and
over the broad range of applications are also rules that broadly conform
to deontologists' demands.

## Utilitarianism Protects Fairness {#utilitarianism-protects-fairness .Tags}

Robin Barrow, Prof. Simon Fraser U, 1991, *Utilitarianism,* p. 29

However the principle of justice may also be equated with the principle
of fairness, and utilitarianism does have such a principle, as it must
do, since a fully fledged ethical theory tells us what is right, and no
account of what is right can compete if it makes no reference to the
distribution of the good.

**Locke**, Writer for American Conservative, **05**

(Robert Locke, Writer for American Conservative, "Marxism of the Right,"
3-14-2005, "Marxism of the Right," *The American Conservative,*
<http://www.amconmag.com/2005_03_14/article1.html>)

The most fundamental problem with libertarianism is very simple:
freedom, though a good thing, is simply not the only good thing in life.
Simple physical security, which even a prisoner can possess, is not
freedom, but one cannot live without it. Prosperity is connected to
freedom, in that it makes us free to consume, but it is not the same
thing, in that one can be rich but as unfree as a Victorian tycoon's
wife. A family is in fact one of the least free things imaginable, as
the emotional satisfactions of it derive from relations that we are
either born into without choice or, once they are chosen, entail
obligations that we cannot walk away from with ease or justice. But
security, prosperity, and family are in fact the bulk of happiness for
most real people and the principal issues that concern governments.
Libertarians try to get around this fact that freedom is not the only
good thing by trying to reduce all other goods to it through the concept
of choice, claiming that everything that is good is so because we choose
to partake of it. Therefore freedom, by giving us choice, supposedly
embraces all other goods. But this violates common sense by denying that
anything is good by nature, independently of whether we choose it.
Nourishing foods are good for us by nature, not because we choose to eat
them. Taken to its logical conclusion, the reduction of the good to the
freely chosen means there are no inherently good or bad choices at all,
but that a man who chose to spend his life playing tiddlywinks has lived
as worthy a life as a Washington or a Churchill. Furthermore, the
reduction of all goods to individual choices presupposes that all goods
are individual. But some, like national security, clean air, or a
healthy culture, are inherently collective. It may be possible to
privatize some, but only some, and the efforts can be comically
inefficient. Do you really want to trace every pollutant in the air back
to the factory that emitted it and sue?

(Ronald 1977, "Taking Rights Seriously" pg 275-276)

[Suppose]{.underline}, for example, that [a number of individuals in the
community holds racist rather than utilitarian political theories. They
believe]{.underline}, not that each man is to count for one and no one
for more than one in the distribution of goods, but rather [that a black
man is to count for less and a white man therefore to count for more
than one.]{.underline} That is an external preference, [but it is
nevertheless a genuine preference for one policy rather than
another,]{.underline} the satisfaction of which will bring pleasure.
[Nevertheless if this preference or pleasure is given the normal weight
in a utilitarian calculation, and blacks suffer accordingly, then their
own assignment of goods and opportunities will depend, not simply on the
competition among personal preferences that abstract statements of
utilitarianism suggest, but precisely on the fact that they are thought
less worthy of concern and respect than others are.
Suppose,]{.underline} to take a different case, [that many members of
the community disapprove on moral grounds of homosexuality, or
contraception, or pornography, or expressions of adherence to the
Communist party]{.underline}. [They prefer not only that they themselves
do not indulge in these activities, but that no one else does so either,
and they believe that a community that permits rather than prohibits
these acts is inherently worse a community.]{.underline} These are
external preferences, but, once again, they are no less genuine, nor
less a source of pleasure when satisfied and displeasure when ignored,
than purely personal preferences. Once again, however [if these external
preferences are counted, so as to justify a constraint on liberty, then
those constrained suffer, not simple because their personal preferences
have lost in a competition for scarce resources with the personal
preferences of the others, but precisely because their conception of a
proper or desirable form of life is despised by others.]{.underline}
These arguments justify the following important conclusion[. If
utilitarian arguments of policy are to be used to justify constraints on
liberty, the care must be taken to insure that the utilitarian
calculations on which the argument is based fix only on personal and
ignore external preferences. That is an important conclusion for
political theory because it shows for example, why the arguments of John
Stuart Mill in On Liberty are not counter-utilitarian, but on the
contrary, arguments in service of the only defensible form of
utilitarianism.]{.underline}

That undecidability resides within the decision, Derrida argues, \"that
justice exceeds law and calculation, that the unpresentable ex­ceeds the
determinable cannot and should not serve as alibi for stay­ing out of
juridico-political battles, within an institution or a state, or between
institutions or states and others.\"^109^ Indeed, \"incalculable jus­tice
requires us to calculate.\" From where do these insistences come? What
is behind, what is animating, these imperatives? It is both the
character of infinite justice as a heteronomic relationship to the
other, a relationship that because of its undecidability multiplies
responsi­bility, and the fact that \"left to itself, the incalculable and
giving *(do­natrice)* idea of justice is always very close to the bad,
even to the worst, for it can always be reappropriated by the most
perverse cal­culation.\" 170 The necessity of calculating the
incalculable thus responds to a duty, a duty that inhabits the instant
of madness and compels the decision to avoid \"the bad,\" the \"perverse
calculation,\" even \"the worst.\" This is the duty that also dwells
with deconstructive thought and makes it the starting point, the \"at
least necessary condition,\" for the organization of resistance to
totalitarianism in all its forms. And it is a duty that responds to
practical political concerns when we rec­ognize that Derrida names the
bad, the perverse, and the worst as those violences \"we recognize all
too well without yet having thought them through, the crimes of
xenophobia, racism, anti-Semitism, reli­gious or nationalist
fanaticism.\"

Furthermore, the duty within the decision, the obligation that
recognizes the necessity of negotiating the possibilities provided by
the impossibilities of justice, is not content with simply avoiding,
con­taining, combating, or negating the worst-violence-though it could
certainly begin with those strategies. Instead, this responsibility,
which is the responsibility of responsibility, commissions a \"utopian\"
strat­egy. Not, a strategy that is beyond all bounds of possibility so as
to be considered \"unrealistic,\" but one

which in respecting the necessity of calculation takes the possibility
summoned by the calculation as far as possible, \"must take it as far as
possible, beyond the place we find ourselves and beyond the already
identifiable zones of morality or politics or law, beyond the
distinction between national and inter­national, public and private, and
so on.\"\"\' As Derrida declares, \"The condition of possibility of this
thing called responsibility is a certain *experience and experiment of
the possibility of the impossible: the testing of the aporia* from which
one may invent the only *possible invention, the impossible
invention.\"\"\'* This leads Derrida to enunciate a proposition that
many, not the least of whom are his Habermasian critics, could hardly
have expected: \"Nothing seems to me *less* outdated than the classical
emancipatory ideal. We cannot attempt to disqualify it to­day, whether
crudely or with sophistication, at least not without treat­ing it too
lightly and forming the worst complicities.\"^14^

Residing within-and not far below the surface-of Derrida\'s account of
the experience of the undecidable as the context for the decision is the
duty of deconstructive thought, the responsibility for the other, and
the opposition to totalitarianism it entails. The Lev­inasian supplement
that Critchley argues deconstruction requires with respect to politics
thus draws out that which is already present. It is, though, perhaps an
element that needs to be drawn out, for Derrida has been candid about,
and often criticized for, his political hesitancy. In answer to a
question about the potential for translating the \"theo­retical
radicality of deconstruction\" into a \"radical political
praxis[,\"]{.underline} Derrida confessed (his term) \"that I have never
succeeded in directly relating deconstruction to *existing* political
codes and programmes.\"^115^ This [\"]{.underline}failure\" is derived
not from any apolitical sentiment within de­constructive thought but from
the \"fundamentally metaphysical\" nature of the political codes within
which both the right and the left presently operate. The problem for
politics that this disjuncture cre­ates is, according to Derrida, that
one has \"to gesture in opposite di­rections at the same time: on the one
hand to preserve a distance and suspicion with regard to the official
political codes governing reality; on the other, to intervene here and
now in a practical and engaged man­ner whenever the necessity arises.\"
This, Derrida laments, results in a \"dual allegiance\" and \"perpetual
uneasiness\" whereby the logic of an argument structured in terms of
\"on the one hand\" and \"on the other hand\" may mean that political
action, which follows from a de­cision between the competing hands, is in
the end insufficient to the intellectual promise of deconstructive
thought^16^ But in *The Other Head­ing,* Derrida\'s reflection on the
question and politics of European identity, the difficulty of
simultaneously gesturing in different direc­tions is posed in an
affirmative political manner.

Suppose that a disease, or a monster, or a war, or something, is killing
people. And suppose you only have enough resources to implement one of
the following two options:

[1. Save 400 lives, with certainty.]{.underline}

[2. Save 500 lives, with 90% probability; save no lives, 10%
probability.]{.underline}

[Most people choose option 1. Which, I think, is foolish; because if you
multiply 500 lives by 90% probability, you get an expected value of 450
lives, which exceeds the 400-life value of option 1.]{.underline} (Lives
saved don\'t diminish in marginal utility, so this is an appropriate
calculation.)

\"What!\" you cry, incensed. \"[How can you gamble with human
lives?]{.underline} How can you think about numbers when so much is at
stake? What if that 10% probability strikes, and everyone dies? So much
for your damned logic! You\'re following your rationality off a cliff!\"
Ah, but [here\'s the interesting thing. If you present the options this
way:]{.underline}

[1. 100 people die, with certainty.]{.underline}

[2. 90% chance no one dies; 10% chance 500 people die.]{.underline}

[Then a majority choose option 2. Even though it\'s the same
gamble]{.underline}. You see, [just as a certainty of saving 400 lives
seems to feel so much more comfortable than an unsure gain, so too, a
certain loss feels worse than an uncertain one]{.underline}. You can
grandstand on the second description too: \"How can you condemn 100
people to certain death when there\'s such a good chance you can save
them? We\'ll all share the risk! [Even if it was only a 75% chance of
saving everyone, it would still be worth it - so long as there\'s a
chance - everyone makes it, or no one does!\"]{.underline} You know
what? This isn\'t about your feelings. A [human life, with all its joys
and all its pains, adding up over the course of decades, is worth far
more than your brain\'s feelings of comfort or discomfort with a plan.
Does computing the expected utility feel too cold-blooded for your
taste? Well, that feeling isn\'t even a feather in the scales, when a
life is at stake. Just shut up and multiply.]{.underline} Previously on
Overcoming Bias, I asked what was the least bad, bad thing that could
happen, and suggested that it was getting a dust speck in your eye that
irritated you for a fraction of a second, barely long enough to notice,
before it got blinked away. And conversely, a very bad thing to happen,
if not the worst thing, would be getting tortured for 50 years. [Now,
would you rather that a googolplex people got dust specks in their eyes,
or that one person was tortured for 50 years? I originally asked this
question with a vastly larger number - an incomprehensible mathematical
magnitude - but a googolplex works fine for this
illustration]{.underline}. [Most people chose the dust specks over the
torture. Many were proud of this choice, and indignant that anyone
should choose otherwise: \"How dare you condone torture!\" This matches
research showing that there are \"sacred values\", like human lives, and
\"unsacred values\", like money. When you try to trade off a sacred
value against an unsacred value, subjects express great
indignation]{.underline} (sometimes they want to punish the person who
made the suggestion). My favorite anecdote along these lines - though my
books are packed at the moment, so no citation for now - comes from [a
team of researchers who evaluated the effectiveness of a certain
project, calculating the cost per life saved, and recommended to the
government that the project be implemented because it was
cost-effective]{.underline}. The governmental agency rejected the report
because, they said[, you couldn\'t put a dollar value on human life.
After rejecting the report, the agency decided not to implement the
measure.]{.underline} Trading off a sacred value (like refraining from
torture) against an unsacred value (like dust specks) feels really
awful. To merely multiply utilities would be too cold-blooded - it would
be following rationality off a cliff\... But let me ask you this.
[Suppose you had to choose between one person being tortured for 50
years, and a googol people being tortured for 49 years, 364 days, 23
hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds. You would choose one person being
tortured for 50 years, I do presume; otherwise I give up on you. And
similarly, if you had to choose between a googol people tortured for
49.9999999 years, and a googol-squared people being tortured for
49.9999998 years, you would pick the former.]{.underline} A googolplex
is ten to the googolth power. That\'s a googol/100 factors of a googol.
So we can keep doing this, gradually - very gradually - diminishing the
degree of discomfort, and multiplying by a factor of a googol each time,
until we choose between a googolplex people getting a dust speck in
their eye, and a googolplex/googol people getting two dust specks in
their eye. [If you find your preferences are circular here, that makes
rather a mockery of moral grandstanding]{.underline}. If you drive from
San Jose to San Francisco to Oakland to San Jose, over and over again,
you may have fun driving, but you aren\'t going anywhere. [Maybe you
think it a great display of virtue to choose for a googolplex people to
get dust specks rather than one person being tortured. But if you would
also trade a googolplex people getting one dust speck for a
googolplex/googol people getting two dust specks et cetera, you sure
aren\'t helping anyone. Circular preferences may work for feeling noble,
but not for feeding the hungry or healing the sick.]{.underline}
Altruism isn\'t the warm fuzzy feeling you get from being altruistic. 
If you\'re doing it for the spiritual benefit, that is nothing but
selfishness.  The primary thing is to help others, whatever the means. 
So shut up and multiply!

people tend to underestimate the probability that at least one of seven
events of 10% probability will occur. Someone judging whether to, e.g.,
incorporate a new startup, must evaluate the probability that many
individual events will all go right (there will be sufficient funding,
competent employees, customers will want the product) while also
considering the likelihood that at least one critical failure will occur
(the bank refuses a loan, the biggest project fails, the lead scientist
dies). [This may help explain why only 44% of entrepreneurial ventures
survive after 4 years]{.underline}. (Knaup 2005.) Dawes (1988) observes:
\'In their summations lawyers avoid arguing from disjunctions (\"either
this or that or the other could have occurred, all of which would lead
to the same conclusion\") in favor of conjunctions. Rationally, of
course, disjunctions are much more probable than are conjunctions.\'
[The scenario of humanity going extinct in the next century is a
disjunctive event. It could happen as a result of any of the existential
risks discussed in this book - or some other cause which none of us fore
saw. Yet for a futurist, disjunctions make for an awkward and
unpoetic-sounding prophecy]{.underline}.

is ultimately determined by personal opinion or social convention or

[Moral rules are very stringent.]{.underline} Lying is allowed only in a
small number of situations, e.g., in a crisis (if one\'s life or that of
another person is endangered by a malevolent character, it is permitted
to lie to the latter to protect the victim) or in certain market places
where it is accepted that telling lies is part of the bargaining
process. In the latter case, care should be taken that deceit does not
spill over into other situations (Bok, 1980, Chap. 8 and p. 131). [Moral
philosophers generally agree that moral rules are severe. Some argue in
favour of severity]{.underline}, e.g., Bok whose book (1980) is
concerned mainly with lying and refers to many authorities favouring
stringency of the rule forbidding lying. Bar-Elli and Heyd (1986) uphold
the stringency of the rule against vengeance, though they grudgingly
admit that it may be regarded as morally justified by the special kind
of personal relationship in the particular situation (p. 85). Some
[philosophers criticize the severity of the demands made by some moral
rules, because of the inconsistencies and asymmetries or even absurdity
they are thought to lead to]{.underline}. I shall refer to two authors:
Williams and Slote. [Williams criticizes morality for attaching
disproportionate importance to obligations and giving them priority over
other ethical considerations. One may not break a promise even if what
was promised was in itself of minor importance and keeping it would
prevent one from furthering some important cause]{.underline} (Williams,
1985, pp.

118 J. MOREH 6-7, 180, 187 and 222, footnote 7). Slote (1985, Chap. 1)
notes [the asymmetry in the prescriptions of moral rules and permissions
allowed by them between the moral agent and others. A moral agent is
allowed to sacrifice a great deal of his3 welfare for the purpose of
promoting the welfare of others by a much smaller amount, yet he is
forbidden to do the reverse (i.e., promote his welfare by a great deal
at the expense of someone else\'s welfare).]{.underline} Slote contends
that if all people count equally, the latter action should be permitted.
Nor is one entitled to sacrifice the life of one person in order to save
the lives of several others. Such an exemption to the rule \'do not
kill\' is not allowed. Nevertheless, a person is permitted to sacrifice
his own life for the sake of saving that of others. Slote mentions these
examples to show that morality is not impartial between the self and
others, as it should be. I am, however, using them to illustrate the
austerity of moral rules.

Fourth, there is what might be called the paradox of relative
stringency. [There is an aura of paradox in asserting that all
deontological duties are categorical --- to be done no matter the
consequences --- and yet asserting that some of such duties are more
stringent than others]{.underline}. A common thought is that "there
cannot be degrees of wrongness with intrinsically wrong acts...," (Frey
1995, 78 n. 3). Yet relative stringency --- ["degrees of
wrongness"]{.underline} --- [seems forced upon the
deontologist]{.underline} by two considerations. First, duties of
differential stringency can be weighed against one another if there is
conflict between them, so that a conflict-resolving, overall duty
becomes possible if duties can be more or less stringent. Second, [when
we punish for the wrongs consisting in our violation of deontological
duties, we]{.underline} (rightly) [do not punish all violations equally.
The greater the wrong, the greater the punishment deserved; and relative
stringency of duty violated]{.underline} (or importance of rights)
[seems the best way of making sense of greater versus lesser
wrongs.]{.underline}

[Fifth, there are situations]{.underline} --- unfortunately not all of
them thought experiments --- [where compliance with deontological norms
will bring about disastrous consequences.]{.underline} To take a stock
example of much current discussion, suppose [that unless A violates the
deontological duty not to torture an innocent person (B), ten, or a
thousand, or a million other innocent people will die because of a
hidden nuclear device.]{.underline} If **[A]{.underline}** is forbidden
by deontological morality from torturing **[B]{.underline}**, many would
regard that as a reductio **[ad absurdum]{.underline}** of deontology.

Ari Kohen. \"The Possibility of Secular Human Rights: Alan Gewirth and
the Principle of Generic Consistency\" Peer Reviewed *Paper presented at
the annual meeting of the Western Political Science Association, March
17, 2005,*
http://www.springerlink.com/content/8crjwyet6g6mr9fh/fulltext.pdf

The trouble with this response is pointed out by Richard Rorty, who
offers the rejoinder, made by an agent who wants to infringe upon the
rights of another, that philosophers like Gewirth \"seem ,oblivious to
blatantly obvious moral distinctions, distinctions any decent person
would draw. \'\'8\~ For Rorty, the problem cannot be solved by sitting
down with a chalkboard and diagramming how the agent and his potential
victim are both PPAs. It is, he argues, a problem that will not be
solved by demonstrating that the agent violates his victim on pain of
self-contradiction because, for this agent, the victim is not properly a
PPA, despite looking and acting very much like one. The old adage about
looking, swimming, and quacking like a duck comes to mind here; no
amount of quacking will convince the agent that his victim is, in fact,
a duck. As Rorty points out,

This rejoinder is not just a rhetorical device, nor is it in any way
irrational. It is heartfelt. The *identity* of these people, the people
whom we should like to convince to join our Eurocentric human rights
culture, is bound up with their sense of who they are *not . . . .* What
is crucial for their sense of who they are is that they are *not* an
infidel, *not* a queer, *not* a woman, *not* an untouchable \.... Since
the days when the term \"human being\" was synonymous with \"member of
our tribe,\" we have always thought of human beings in terms *of
paradigm* members of the species. We have contrasted *us,* the *real*
humans, with rudimentary or perverted or deformed examples of humanity.
82

There are, I believe, two problems for Gewirth\'s theory here. The first
is that an agent can quite clearly sidestep rational inconsistency by
believing that his victim is somehow less of an agent (and, in the case
presented by Rorty, less of a human being) than he is himself. The
agent, here, might recognize that his victim is a PPA, but other factors
(being an infidel, a queer, a woman, or an untouchable) have far greater
resonance and preclude her having the same rights as the agent. He might
also recognize his victim as a potential PPA, but not one in the fullest
sense of that term or one who has actually achieved that status; as
Gewirth himself notes, \"there are degrees of approach to being
prospective purposive agents. \'\'83 It seems to me that the Nazis knew
quite well that their Jewish victims could be PPAs in some sense; the
Nuremberg Laws of 1935 confirm their awareness that Jews could plan and
execute the same sorts of actions they could (voting and working, for
example). The rights of the Jews could be restricted, however, because
Jews were quite different from Germans; rather than PPAs in the fullest
sense, they were, in the eyes of the Nazis, what Rorty calls
\"pseudohumans. \'\'\~4 On this point, Rorty\'s point is both clear and
compelling: \"Resentful young Nazi toughs were quite aware that many
Jews were clever and learned, but this only added to the pleasure they
took in beating such Jews. Nor does it do much good to get such people
to read Kant and agree that one should not treat rational agents simply
as means. For everything turns on who counts as a fellow human being, as
a rational agent in the only relevant sense\--the sense in which
rational agency is synonymous with membership in *our* moral community.
\'\'s5 The second problem for the PGC pointed out by Rorty is that it is
overly academic and insufficiently pragmatic. In other words, its
fifteen steps might be logically compelling to those in a philosophy
department, but not to those who are actually making these decisions on
inclusion and exclusion. \"This is not,\" Rorty tells us, \"because they
are insufficiently rational. It is, typically, because they live in a
world in which it would be just too risky\-- indeed, would often be
insanely dangerous\--to let one\'s sense of moral community stretch
beyond one\'s family, clan, or tribe. \'\'86 This second point leads to
the final critique of Gewirth\'s argument for the PGC.

Discussion among philosophers often stops at the point of fundamental
disagreement over moral principles, just as discussion among strategists
often stops at the point of disagreement over hypothetical assertions
about deterrence. But most moral theorists \-- and all utilitarians \--
also require consideration of hypothetical\
assertions to reach their conclusions, although they are typically even
less adept at objective, causal argument\
than are strategists, who are themselves often quite casual with their
social scientific claims. Even if one\
wishes to argue principally from deontological principles, one must have
some confidence in one\'s social scientific expectations to decide
whether consequences might not in this instance be overriding. Only a
deontologist who held the extraordinary position that consequences never
matter could easily reach a conclusion on nuclear weapons without
considering the quality of various outcomes. Alas, on this dreadful
issue good causal arguments are desperately needed.

## Deontology is a terrible system for policy- policies must use means to an end framework and are judged by their effectiveness  {#deontology-is-a-terrible-system-for-policy--policies-must-use-means-to-an-end-framework-and-are-judged-by-their-effectiveness .Tags}

At the same time, deontologically based ethical systems have severe
practical limitations as a basis for

public policy. At best, a priori moral principles provide only general
guidance to ethical dilemmas in public affairs and do not themselves
suggest appropriate public policies, and at worst, they create a regimen
of regulatory unreasonableness while failing to adequately address the
problem or actually making it worse. For example, a moral obligation to
preserve the environment by no means implies the best way, or any way
for that matter, to do so, just as there is no a priori reason to
believe that any policy that claims to preserve the environment will
actually do so. Any number of policies might work, and others, although
seemingly consistent with the moral principle, will fail utterly. That
deontological principles are an inadequate basis for environmental
policy is evident in the rather significant irony that most forms of
deontologically based environmental laws and regulations tend to be
implemented in a very utilitarian manner by street-level enforcement
officials. Moreover, ignoring the relevant costs and benefits of
environmental policy and their attendant incentive structures can, as
alluded to above, actually work at cross purposes to environmental
preservation. (There exists an extensive literature on this aspect of
regulatory enforcement and the often perverse outcomes of regulatory
policy. See, for example, Ackerman, 1981; Bartrip and Fenn, 1983;
Hawkins, 1983, 1984; Hawkins and Thomas, 1984.) Even the most die-hard
preservationist/deontologist would, I believe, be troubled by this
outcome. The above points are perhaps best expressed by Richard
Flathman, The number of values typically involved in public policy
decisions, the broad categories which must be employed and above all,
thescope and complexity of the consequences to be anticipated militate
against reasoning soconclusively that they generate an imperative to
institute a specific policy. It is seldom the case that only one policy
will meet the criteria of the public interest (1958, p. 12). It
therefore follows that in a democracy, policymakers have an ethical duty
to establish a plausible link between policy alternatives and the
problems they address, and the public must be reasonably assured that a
policy will actually do something about an existing problem; this
requires the means-end language and methodology of utilitarian ethics.
Good intentions, lofty rhetoric, and moral piety are an
insufficient,though perhaps at times a necessary, basis for public
policy in a democracy.

**Hinman98**

(Lawrence Hinman is a professor of Ethics" Ethics: A Pluralistic
Approach to Moral Theory", p. 186)

When, for example, we want to assess the moral correctness of proposed
governmental legislation, we may well wish to set aside any question of
the intentions of the legislators. After all good laws may be passed for
the most venal of political motives, and bad legislation may be the
outcome of quite good intentions. Instead, we can concentrate solely on
the question of what ***effects*** the legislation may have on the
people. When we make this shift, we are not necessarily denying that
individual intentions are important on some level, but rather confining
our attention to a level on which those intentions become largely
irrelevant. This is particularly appropriate in the case of policy
decisions by governments, corporations, or other groups. In such cases
there may be a diversity of different intentions that one may want to
treat as essentially private matters hwen assessing the moral worth of
the proposed law, policy, or action. Therefore, rule utilitarianism\'s
neglect of intentions intuitively makes the most sense when we are
assessing the moral worth of some large-scale policy proposed by an
entity consisting of more than one individual.

## Deontology in policy making fails to uphold democracy and legitimizes oppression. {#deontology-in-policy-making-fails-to-uphold-democracy-and-legitimizes-oppression. .Tags}

**Institute For Public Policy 97** \[ Institute For Public Policy New

Regarding the policymaking role of deontological philosophy in a
democracy, I am concerned about the

same issue that concerned scholars such as Herman Finer and Victor
Thompson\--the specter of

policymakers (whether elected or unelected) imposing their own
perceptions of higher-order moral principles on an unwilling or
uninformed society. History has shown that the imposition of
higher-order moral principles from above all too often degenerates into
instrumental oppression. Thus as Finer has\--I believe
correctly\--pointed out, the crucial difference between democracy and
totalitarianism is the people\'s power to exact obedience to the public
will. In a democracy, values are not \"discovered\" by policy activists;
instead, yhey emerge out of the democratic process. For this reason I
find very troubling the suggestion by Joel Kassiola that environmental
ethics requires that "such long-standing and powerful values as national
sovereignty and property rights will have to be ethically assessed and,
perhaps, redefined or subordinated to a

more morally-weighty, environmentally-based values and policies." I
cannot help but wonder just who will

be doing the "refining" and "subordinating" of these values and how this
is to be done. As Kurt Baier reminds us, in a democracy "the moral rules
and convictions of any group can and should be subjected to certain
tests" (1958, p. 12). That test is the submission of those moral rules
and convictions

to the sovereign public. While policymakers are expected to sort out the
value conflicts that arise in light of their duty to serve the public
interest, they are seldom entitled to act solely according to some
perceived a priori moral imperative. (Those who would act this way in
the case of environmental policy are aptly described by Bob Taylor as
"environmental ethicists who discover \'truth\' even though this truth
can\'t or won\'t be seen by their fellow citizens.") Herein lies one of
the important moral dilemmas of democratic government. Individuals are
free, within the constraints of law, to act on perceived moral
imperatives; democratic governments are not. It is, for example, one
thing for individuals to donate their property for environmental
preservation, but it is quite another thing for the government

to seize private lands (i.e., redefine property rights) for the same
purpose.

## Deontology fails\-- no way of evaluating conflicting obligations  {#deontology-fails---no-way-of-evaluating-conflicting-obligations .Tags}

**Rainbow 2002** \[ Catherine Rainbow is a teacher at Davidson

http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/kabernd/Indep/carainbow/Theories.htm\]

Although deontology contains many positive attributes, it also contains
its fair number of flaws. One weakness of this theory is that there **is
no rationale or logical basis for deciding an individual\'s duties**.
For instance, businessman may decide that it is his duty to always be on
time to meetings. Although this appears to be a noble duty we do not
know why the person chose to make this his duty. Perhaps the reason that
he has to be at the meeting on time is that he always has to sit in the
same chair. A similar scenario unearths two other faults of deontology
including the fact that sometimes a person\'s duties conflict, and that
deontology is not concerned with the welfare of others. For instance, if
the deontologist who must be on time to meetings is running late, how is
he supposed to drive? Is the deontologist supposed to speed, breaking
his duty to society to uphold the law, or is the deontologist supposed
to arrive at his meeting late, breaking his duty to be on time? **This
scenario of conflicting obligations does not lead us to a clear
ethically correct resolution** nor does it protect the welfare of others
from the deontologist\'s decision. Since deontology is not based on the
context of each situation, it does not provide any guidance when one
enters a complex situation in which there are conflicting obligations
(1,2).

Among the criticisms of deontological theory is that it is difficult to
get universal agreement on

what principles should be considered fundamental. It is also difficult
to prioritize and to apply

such abstract principles as truth telling and the sanctity of life to
specific cases that arise in one's

day-to-day work. In addition, the application of certain principles,
without reference to

consequences, can have extremely negative results---for example, when
telling the truth results

in penalties for well-intentioned actions. Moreover, it is often the
case that one principle will

come into conflict with another. A celebrated example is truth telling
versus the sanctity of life

when one is considering whether to lie to a prospective murderer about
the location of the

intended victim. It is also argued that if exceptions are made in the
application of a principle, **it**

**cannot be considered a fundamental one**. Many deontologists, however,
would approve of

exceptions when a greater moral principle is at stake. At a less
dramatic level than life and death,

one can envisage an evaluator having to choose between the public's
right to know and a client's

right to privacy.

**Rainbow 2002** \[ Catherine Rainbow is a teacher at Davidson

In the rights ethical theory the rights set forth by a society are
protected and given the highest priority. Rights are considered to be
ethically correct and valid since a large or ruling population endorses
them. Individuals may also bestow rights upon others if they have the
ability and resources to do so (1). For example, a person may say that
her friend may borrow the car for the afternoon. The friend who was
given the ability to borrow the car now has a right to the car in the
afternoon. A major complication of this theory on a larger scale,
however, is that one must decipher what the characteristics of a right
are in a society. The society has to determine what rights it wants to
uphold and give to its citizens. In order for a society to determine
what rights it wants to enact, it must decide what the society\'s goals
and ethical priorities are. Therefore, in order for the rights theory to
be useful, it must be used in conjunction with another ethical theory
that will consistently explain the goals of the society (1). For example
in America people have the right to choose their religion because this
right is upheld in the Constitution. One of the goals of the founding
fathers\' of America was to uphold this right to freedom of religion.
However, under Hitler\'s reign in Germany, the Jews were persecuted for
their religion because Hitler decided that Jews were detrimental to
Germany\'s future success. The American government upholds freedom of
religion while the Nazi government did not uphold it and, instead, chose
to eradicate the Jewish religion and those who practiced it.

Blowing up the fat man is indeed monstrous. But letting him remain stuck
while the whole group drowns is still more monstrous. The
consequentialist is on strong moral ground here, and, if his reflective
moral convictions do not square either with certain unrehearsed or with
certain reflective particular moral convictions of human beings, so much
the worse for such commonsense moral convictions. One could even
usefully and relevantly adapt here-though for a quite different
purpose-an argument of Donagan\'s. Consequentialism of the kind I have
been arguing for provides so persuasive \"a theoretical basis for common
morality that when it contradicts some moral intuition, it is natural to
suspect that intuition, not theory, is corrupt.\" Given the
comprehensiveness, plausibility, and overall rationality of
consequentialism, it is not unreasonable to override even a deeply felt
moral conviction if it does not square with such a

theory, though, if it made no sense or overrode the bulk of or even a
great many of our considered moral convictions that would be another
matter indeed Anticonsequentialists often point to the inhumanity of
people who will sanction such killing of the innocent but cannot the
compliment be returned by speaking of the even greater inhumanity,
conjoined with evasiveness, of those who will allow even more death and
far greater misery and then excuse themselves on the ground that they
did not intend the death and misery but merely forbore to prevent it? In
such a context, such reasoning and such forbearing to prevent seems to
me to constitute a moral evasion. I say it is evasive because rather
than steeling himself to do what in normal circumstances would be a
horrible and vile act but in this circumstance is a harsh moral
necessity he

allows. when he has the power to prevent it, a situation which is still
many times worse. He tries to keep his \'moral purity\' and \[to\] avoid
\'dirty hands\' at the price of utter moral failure and what Kierkegaard
called \'double-mindedness.\' It is understandable that people should
act in this morally evasive way but this does not make it right.

Support of Consequentialism and Rejection of Deontology"
<http://pritchea.myweb.uga.edu/phil3200paper1.htm>\]

Throughout the article, Nielsen concurrently argues that deontology
should be rejected but that consequentialism is viable. We may
reconstruct his argument as follows: Deontology, as a morally absolute
theory, makes mistakes. Likewise, an absolutist form of consequentialism
also makes mistakes. So absolutism is wrong. Unfortunately, deontology
can only be formulated as some type of "moral absolutism," while
consequentialism can be flexible. Therefore, deontology should be
rejected, and by rejecting deontology we are left with consequentialism
as a viable theory.Nielsen relied heavily on examples to support his
first premise that deontology makes mistakes. He discussed warfare to
show how it is not the case that one is necessarily morally corrupt if
he or she knowingly kills the innocent while making moves to kill
combatants, but this point would not have been salient without having
seen the movie he referred to, *The Battle of Algiers*. Nielsen did
present an effective example, though, with the "case of the innocent fat
man." In this thought experiment, a fat man is leading a group of people
out of a cave when he gets hopelessly stuck in the opening. There is a
rising tide that will cause everyone inside the cave to drown unless
they can get out. The only option for removing the fat man is to blast
him out with dynamite that someone happens to have. Nielsen explains
that the deontologist would hold that the fat man must not be blasted
and killed because this would violate the prohibition against killing
and it is only nature responsible for everyone else drowning. Nielsen
challenges this principle by declaring that anyone in such a situation,
including the fat man, should understand that the right thing to do is
blast the fat man out in order to save the many lives in the cave.
Furthermore, [the]{.underline} deontologist exhibits "moral evasion"
whenever he stands idly by and allows a greater tragedy than is
necessary to occur. Nielsen explains that this is the kind of example
that highlights the corrupt nature of deontology.

survival the highest value, he has declared that there is nothing he
will not betray. But [for a civilization to sacrifice itself makes no
sense since there are not survivors to give meaning to the sacrifical

possible to avoid the \"moral calamity of a policy like unilateral
disarmament that forces us to choose between being dead or red (while
increasing the chances of both)\"?]{.underline}74 How one judges the
issue of ends can be affected by how one poses the questions. If one
asks \"[what is worth a billion lives]{.underline} (or the survival of
the species),\" it is natural to resist contemplating a positive answer.
But suppose one asks, \"[is it possible to imagine any threat to our
civilization and values that would justify raising the threat to a
billion lives from one in ten thousand to one in a thousand for a
specific period]{.underline}?\" Then there are several plausible
answers, including a democratic way of life and cherished freedoms that
give meaning to life beyond mere survival. [When we pursue several
values simultaneously, we face the fact that they often conflict and
that we face difficult tradeoffs. If we make one value absolute in
priority, we are likely to get that value and little else]{.underline}.
[Survival is a necessary condition for the enjoyment of other values,
but that does not make it sufficient.]{.underline} Logical priority does
not make it an absolute value. Few people act as though survival were an
absolute value in their personal lives, or they would never enter an
automobile. [We can give survival of the species a very high priority
without giving it the paralyzing status of an absolute value. Some
degree of risk is unavoidable if individuals or societies are to avoid
paralysis and enhance the quality of life beyond mere survival. The
degree of that risk is a justifiable topic of both prudential and moral
reasoning.]{.underline}

acceptability of social institutions and policies (including nuclear
deterrence), a broad consequentialist might demand that the benefit they
produce be not only large but also not achievable by an alternative that
would respect rules. 40 [In addition, to protect against the basic
difficulties of comparing different people\'s interests when making
utilitarian calculations, a broad consequentialist would require very
substantial majorities; otherwise he would base his decisions on rules
and rights-based grounds]{.underline}. [A consequentialist argument can
also be provided for giving some weight to motives as well as
means]{.underline}. For example William Safire argues that \"the
[protection of acting in good faith, with no malicious intent, is what
make decision-making possible. It applies to all of us. . .
.]{.underline} The doctor who undertakes a risky operation, the lawyer
who gambles on an unorthodox defense to save his client, the businessman
who bets the company on a new product.\"42 [While such an argument can
be abused if good motives are treated as an automatic one-dimensional
exculpation, it can be used by broad consequentialists as a grounds for
including evaluation of motives in the overall judgment of an
act.]{.underline} Whether one accepts the broad consequentialist
approach or chooses some other, more eclectic way to include and
reconcile the three dimensions of complex moral issues,43 there will
often be a sense of uneasiness about the answers, not just because of
the complexity of the [problems \"but simply that there is no
satisfactory solution to these issues-at least none that appears to
avoid in practice what most men would still regard as an intolerable
sacrifice of value.\"44 When value is sacrificed, there is often the
problem of \"dirty hands.\" Not all ethical decisions are pure ones. The
absolutist may avoid the problem of dirty hands, but often at the cost
of having no hands at all. Moral theory cannot be \"rounded
off]{.underline} and made complete and tidy.\" That is part of the
modern human condition. [But that does not exempt us from making
difficult moral choices.]{.underline}

[Anticonsequentialists often point to the inhumanity of people who will
sanction such killing of the innocent, but cannot the compliment be
returned by speaking of the even greater inhumanity]{.underline},
conjoined with evasiveness, [of those who will allow even more death and
far greater misery]{.underline} and then excuse themselves [on the
ground that they did not intend the death and misery but merely forbore
to prevent it?]{.underline} In such a context, [such reasoning and such
forbearing to prevent seems to me to constitute a moral
evasion]{.underline}. I say it is evasive because rather than steeling
himself to do what in normal circumstances would be a horrible and vile
act but in this circumstance is a harsh moral necessity, he allows, when
he has the power to prevent it, a situation which is still many times
worse. [He tries to keep his \'moral purity\' and avoid \'dirty hands\'
at the price of utter moral failure and what Kierkegaard called
\'double-mindedness.\' It is understandable that people should act in
this morally evasive way but this does not make it right]{.underline} My
consequentialist reasoning about such cases as the case of the innocent
fat man is very often resisted on the grounds that it starts a very
dangerous precedent. [People rationalize wildly and irrationally in
their own favor in such situations. To avoid such rationalization, we
must stubbornly stick to our deontological principles and recognize as
well that very frequently, if people will put their wits to work or just
endure, such admittedly monstrous actions done to prevent still greater
evils will turn out to be unnecessary.]{.underline}

I maintain, once again, that this sort of [moral theorizing fails
because our intuitions do not reflect a coherent set of moral truths and
were not designed by natural selection or anything else to behave as if
they were]{.underline}. And note that this is the case for a single
person's intuitions. [Troubles]{.underline} only [multiply when one must
reconcile the conflicting intuitions of many different

possibility of reinventing normative ethics as an attempt to organize

make sense of your moral sense, turn to biology, psychology, and
sociology---not normative ethics.]{.underline}

Moral realists, and those anti-realists who would emulate them, have the
option of dogmatism, of blindly acting by moral norms that one takes to
be authoritative. Revisionists, in contrast, have no choice but to
acknowledge that all moral judgment is an imprecise process of weighing
values. [The nature of moral action requires the drawing of
lines:]{.underline} One either jumps in and saves the drowning child, or
one does not. One either votes to allow abortion or one does not. Of
course, one will sometimes make compromises by adopting middle-ofthe-
road courses of action, but, at some level, all action is discrete. [To
any particular course of action one must say either "yes" or
"no."]{.underline} Thus, while the inputs to moral judgment are fuzzy,
fluid, and continuous considerations, the practical outputs of moral
judgment are discrete actions. [Deontology is intuitively appealing
because it offers answers as clear and forceful as our intuitions,
drawing theoretical lines that translate into practical lines, the kinds
of lines that we, like it or not, are forced to draw by the nature of
action. But, contrary to appearances, nature contains no true moral
lines. We begin with only a mush of]{.underline} 298 [morally relevant
considerations, things we care about, and any lines that get drawn must
be drawn by us. Therefore, any attempt to settle a moral question with
deontological appeals to rights, obligations, etc. always begs the
question. Such appeals are merely attempts to settle moral issues by
insisting that they have, in effect, already been settled by Mother
Moral Nature and the lines she has drawn.]{.underline}

What goes for private debates about marital infidelity goes for public
moral debates as well. [In the context of an openly anti-realist
dialogue, what would it mean to say that a fetus has a right to life or
that a woman has a right to choose?]{.underline} If all one means in
saying these things is that one is against abortion, or in favor of
allowing it, then why not just say that?17 Packaging one's opinion as a
claim about "rights" is just pointless propaganda. [Perhaps, one might
argue, that an appeal to a right can be understood as an appeal to a
default assumption]{.underline}. To appeal to the moral right to free
speech, for example, might be to appeal to the generally accepted
principle that people should be able to say what they want in almost all
cases. [The problem is that in any real controversy in which "rights"
are invoked, the question is inevitably about the limits of those
rights]{.underline}. T[herefore, it is pointless18 for civil
libertarians to defend flag-burning by appeal to the right to free
speech, regardless of how natural this feels]{.underline}. Everyone is
generally in favor of free speech. [The debate is about whether to make
an exception for this sort of speech. Pointing out that this case would
be an exception does nothing to change the minds of those who want it to
be an exception. In this case, as in others, appeals to rights are, once
again, just question-begging propaganda, useless in the face of
anti-realists who know the meta-ethical truth and aren't willing to play
along.]{.underline}

[In contrast, one can appeal to "good" and "bad" consequences without
propagandizing.]{.underline} A pro-life conservative might say, for
example, that restricting abortion rights is "good" (or "good" in
certain respects) because it teaches people important lessons in
personal responsibility. This claim is not empty. A young woman who gets
pregnant as a result of irresponsible choices and is forced to carry a
baby to term and give it up for adoption is likely to learn some
valuable life lessons that she might not learn if given the option to
end her pregnancy with a pill. This sort of claim contributes to a
meaningful dialogue because it's something a pro-choice liberal can
acknowledge. [He can agree that there is an up side to anti-choice
legislation, but then go on to argue that these advantages are
outweighed by the disadvantages, "bad" things that an honest
conservative can acknowledge as bad, such as harm caused by illegal
abortions.]{.underline} Of course, this kind of dialogue may not resolve
the issue. There may remain untestable factual assumptions on either
side concerning, for example, the existence of God and the nature of His
will. Likewise, there may remain brute evaluative differences, for
example, over the various weights to attach to the mutually acknowledged
"good" and "bad" consequences of (dis)allowing abortion. [But getting
rid of question-begging talk of "rights" and establishing some common
ground about advantages and disadvantages may help focus the issue. If,
for example, the pro-choice camp could get the pro-life camp to
acknowledge that its opposition to abortion is ultimately grounded in
untestable religious beliefs and nothing else, that would be a very
worthwhile achievement.]{.underline}

Stanford. "Three Conceptions of Action in Moral Theory" *Ous*, Mar 2001,
Vol. 35 Issue 1, p93, 25p Ebsco\]

Kamm's view of action, though less explicit and developed, shares this
propositional orientation. An action in accordance with moral
constraints, Kamm claims, states that another person has or lacks value
as a matter of fact. And since there is such a fact of the matter,
actions can succeed or fail to express the truth.18 And yet on both
Wollaston's and Kamm's accounts, the world to which action relates us
descriptively is not the utilitarian's world of natural causes and
effects. The claim that "you're really something" is a not a claim about
a person's empirical or psychological state; rather it is a claim about
his status.19 Similarly, the examples Wollaston invokes to illustrate
his theory of action all involve claims about the status of an agent in
relation to others. Thus Wollaston's view, echoed by Kamm, seems to be
that action "tracks" certain practical facts---facts about "where we
stand" in relation to one another as members of a social world.
Wollaston's conception of action seems to presuppose a moral psychology
which is different from Cumberland's. While Wollaston would not deny
that every action involves an exercise of efficient causality, his view
suggests that our ultimate practical concern is not for the effects we
can produce. Indeed his conception implies that in addition to a causal
element, action contains a reflexive element. The exercise of human
agency, according to Wollaston, involves a reflective awareness of
ourselves in relation to others.20 Action expresses a conception of
"where we stand" in relation to the other constituents of the world,
conceived as a realm of status relations. Moreover, this awareness
determines an ultimate end of action which is not an effect to be
brought about. That end is the faithful representation of the
interpersonal order of which we are members.

The Normalcy and Normalization of Discrimination Because counterfactual
thinking influences our reactions to and explanations of negative
events, [biases in counterfactual thinking have the potential to distort
our assessments of discriminatory outcomes at several
levels]{.underline}. First, [they can mute our reactions to
discrimination]{.underline} generally, [leading us to tolerate and even
to accept unequal outcomes]{.underline}. Our acceptance of
discrimination is not due solely to a general indifference or hardness
toward groups that are vulnerable to discrimination, but results in part
from the specific ways in which our preference for the normal or
customary affects how we process and evaluate events and behavior. That
is, the [normality bias leads us to react less strongly to (and perhaps
to not even notice) misfortunes that we take for granted or that follow
an expected pattern]{.underline}. This [bias]{.underline} also promotes
the entrenchment of those patterns because it [leads us to accept the
established order]{.underline} but to End jarring, [and therefore to
resist, challenges to those accepted ways]{.underline}. Furthermore, it
makes it easier for us to justify the established patterns by viewing
them as rational and even fair. Second, when a case of alleged
discrimination does come under scrutiny, [biases in counterfactual
thinking can distort our causal explanations of the events in question
and our evaluations of the parties]{.underline}. Because determining
whether discrimination has occurred is "fundamentally an exercise in
causal attribution,\"7 [the relative normality or mutability of the
parties\' conduct can influence our judgments of their roles in
producing the outcome in a way that leads us to reduce the perpetrator's
responsibility and ascribe undue responsibility to the
victim]{.underline}. More broadly, [our judgments of blame and sympathy
create a feedback loop that reinforces the norms,]{.underline}
expectations, and practices [that contributed to our biased judgments
and perpetuate discriminatory reactions and behavior]{.underline}.
Immutable Wrongs and Suitable Victims [The more easily we can imagine
the victim]{.underline} of a tragic fate avoiding it, [the more badly we
will feel that be has suffered]{.underline}, so that the level of
sympathy we feel and the amount of compensation we dole out may turn on
trivial differences in the circumstances of a tragedy. In the burglary
study discussed earlier, for example, subjects expressed greater
sympathy for victims if their homes were burglarized the night before
they returned from vacation than if the burglary occurred several weeks
before their return. Similarly, subjects in another study recommended
significantly higher compensatory awards for a convenience store
customer who was shot during a robbery at a store he rarely patronized
than for a customer who was shot at his regular store. They also awarded
significantly higher amounts to a plane crash victim who managed to walk
miles through a remote area only to die one-quarter of a mile from the
nearest town than to one who traveled just as far but died seventy-five
miles from the nearest town." In none of the studies did the victims'
losses or suffering differ based on the circumstances of their
misfortunes. Nevertheless, the fate of the more highly compensated
victims seemed more poignant and the victims themselves more deserving
of sympathy, because subjects could more easily imagine positive
outcomes for them. A positive counterfactual also may come more easily
to mind, as Delgado's examples suggest, when it is not normal for a
person to suffer a particular fate. Recall the bursting of the "dot-com
E bubble," when unemployment figures began to reflect not just the usual
losses of blue-collar and lower-skilled service jobs but also
substantial losses of high-paying, white-collar jobs. Numerous news
articles highlighted and analyzed the trend, labeling the \` downturn a
\"white-collar recession" and sympathetically profiling the newly idle
(and mostly White) college educated professionals for whom unemployment
was both a hardship and a shock. Although white collar professionals
during that period did A indeed suffer higher rates of unemployment than
were typical for that group, they were not, as many assumed, the hardest
hit: the groups that "usually get clobbered" by unemployment---blue-
collar workers, lower-skilled workers, people of color---continued to
bear disproportionately higher job losses. The misfortunes of unemployed
professionals drew more attention and greater sympathy in part because,
as one economist put it, "They are not the people who come right to mind
when you think about the jobless."·\*° Similarly, our attention and
sympathy for crime victims varies according to how accustomed we are to
seeing them---or, to be more precise, people like them---suffer crime
and violence. Even the same, equally appalling forms of victimization
can elicit different degrees of concern depending on race and class. A
couple of high-profile cases from recent years illustrate this point.
Many readers will likely recall the highly publicized 1989 case of the
Central Park jogger---a case so famous that this reference to its victim
generally suffices to identify it. As Kimberle Crenshaw has noted, this
case, which was believed at the time to have involved the gang rape and
brutal beating of a White investment banker by as many as twelve Black
youths," drew massive, sensationalized media Coverage, provoked
widespread public outrage, and even prompted Donald Trump to take out "a
full page ad in four New York newspapers demanding that New York 'Bring
Back the Death Penalty, Bring Back Our Police.\"'" While she does not
suggest that the Central Park jogger's ease did not merit great concern,
Crenshaw does point out the dramatic disparity between the level of
concern that case evoked and the virtual silence of the media with
regard to the "twenty-eight other cases of first-degree rape or
attempted rape\" that were reported in New York that same week---many of
which were "as horrific as the rape in Central Park,\"" but most of
which included victims who were women of color. Similarly, the great
attention paid to a more recent and perhaps equally famous case---the
June 2002 abduction of Elizabeth Smart, a White teenager from an
affluent Utah family---contrasted sharply with the relative lack of
coverage given a similar case that same spring: the disappearance of
Alexis Patterson, a seven-year-old African American girl, in April 2002.
By one account, the Smart story received ten times the media coverage
given Patter- son's case: one thousand newspaper articles and television
reports on Smart versus one hundred on Patterson.34 Reporters, editors,
and producers denied that the victims' race played any role in the
amount of attention their cases received, pointing out that a number of
factors distinguished them: Smart was abducted from her own bedroom in
the middle of the night while Patterson disappeared during her walk to
school, the police departments may have worked differently in sharing
information with the media, and the Smart parents, with their
\"perfect\" family, may have been perceived more sympathetically than
the Pattersons. Aside from these circumstantial differences, however, a
number of journalists and commentators noted that race probably did make
a difference---not because the media consciously resist reporting
stories with Black victims, but because of their sense of \"what makes a
compelling national· story.\"3 [What makes a compelling
story]{.underline}, however, [often correlates with race and
class]{.underline}. As one veteran Black journalist put it bluntly,
\"[whatever happens in a black neighborhood doesn't really surprise
anybody. The public is conditioned to expect that]{.underline}. \"37 In
other words, [the explanation may be simply that crime and violence are
an accepted part of Black people's \"rough road in life.\"38 Their
suffering is normal and therefore unremarkable.]{.underline}
Furthermore, we take for granted not just who suffers but also how their
suffering plays out. That is, we become inured to misfortunes that a
story line with which we are familiar, because the victims' experiences
are hard to imagine otherwise. The more muted reactions to deaths from
enemy versus friendly illustrate this point. [Familiarity accustoms us
to racial and other group-based discrimination]{.underline} as well,
[because that kind of misfortune often follows standard
scripts]{.underline}. In their analysis of reactions to the bombing of a
synagogue in France that injured several people, social psychologists
Dale T Miller and William Turnbull pointed out that one need not embrace
a discriminatory viewpoint in order to assimilate the expectation that
certain harms are normal for some people but not for others: France's
then Prime Minister publicly denounced the attack and expressed his
sympathy for both the jews who were inside the synagogue and the
\"innocent passersby.\" The Prime Minister's differentiation of the
victims and innocent passersby provoked considerabl\[e\] outrage because
many interpreted it as implying that he did not consider the jews to be
as innocent as the passersby. Certainly the term innocent has a strong
moral connotation, but should we assume that the Prime Minister's
remarks reflect anti-Semitism? Not necessarily. His failure to apply the
term innocent to the jews inside the synagogue may reflect the fact that
his mental representation of a synagogue enabled him to mentally remove
passersby from the vicinity more easily than the attending jews. That
the passersby were not the intended victims of the attack also makes
their injuries less taken-for-granted and thus easier to undo mentally
(although no more or less deserved) than those of the jews. What need
not have been, ought not to have been.3' As this incident suggests, [the
more readily we recognize the patterns that discrimination follows, the
harder it is for us to undo mentally the routine discrimination we
expect and witness, the more congruous and less remarkable we find its
victims'· losses, and the more acceptable they become]{.underline}. As a
result, [even extreme acts of discrimination such as bias-motivated
violence can play a role in normalizing discrimination to the extent
that they define the expected targets for aggression and ill
treatment.]{.underline} Observers of bias, crimes understand immediately
and viscerally why the victim was singled out because they recognize the
pattern that such crime follows. As Iris Marion Young has explained,
[the social environment surrounding acts of violence]{.underline},
harassment, intimidation, and ridicule [of particular groups makes those
acts \"possible and even acceptable]{.underline}. This pattern of
acceptance also characterizes the less dramatic, more mundane types of
discrimination that members of some groups experience routinely. Dorothy
E. Roberts has pointed out, for example, that habitual racial profiling
in law enforcement con- tributes to an environment in which both the
imposition of physical suffering on members of certain groups and the
infringement of their constitutional rights are expected and minimized.
First, discriminatory targeting by law enforcement officers reinforces
the perception that some groups are \"second-class citizens\" for whom
police surveillance and even arrest are \"perfectly natural.\" In turn,
[this belief promotes the view that those groups are entitled to fewer
liberties and that their rights are \"mere 'amenities' that may be
sacrificed to protect law-a biding people.]{.underline}\" Acceptance of
this view results in an environment in which a pattern of discriminatory
targeting seems benign, for \"[when social understandings are so
uncontested that they become invisible, the social meanings that arise
from them appear natural]{.underline}. Similarly, Deseriee A. Kennedy
has explained that consumer discrimination---the commercial version of
racial profiling in which retail establishments single out Black and
Brown shoppers for heightened surveillance and other ill
treatment---also insinuates itself into our expectations of how people
of color should be treated: \"Everyday racism perpetuates itself---it
becomes integrated into everyday situations and becomes 'part of the
expected, of the unquestionable, and of what is seen as normal by the
dominant group.\"\"'2 And as we shall see, a history of inferior care
has led to the view that minorities inevitably will suffer worse health
outcomes because "those people\" generally don't do well.43 In addition
to being familiar and therefore [norma]{.underline}l, our scripts,
[schemas]{.underline}, and prototypes [for discrimination incorporate
other factors that make discriminatory outcomes seem
inevitable]{.underline} and lead us to take them for granted. [The
standard discrimination schema includes a perpetrator who intentionally
targets a member of a disfavored group]{.underline} for ill treatment
and whose intentional wrong- doing is triggered [by his \"taste for
discrimination]{.underline}\"---[a force both irrational and outside his
control]{.underline}. Both the assumptions that discrimination is
intended and that its perpetrators are driven to it tend to make
discrimination seem ineluctable, with all the implications that the
appearance of immutability carries. As Miller and Turnbull suggested
with reference to the synagogue bombing, when a victim is seen as an
intended target, the victim's fate is harder to undo mentally. As they
also have explained, victims' losses are more easily taken for granted
when the harm they suffer was required in order for the perpetrator to
achieve his goals---\"even when \[those\] goals \[are\]
reprehensible."4' This tendency was confirmed in yet another victim
compensation study, in which subjects showed less sympathy toward and
recommended less compensation for a victim whose dog was killed by a
burglar when the dog's barking \"threatened the burglar's mission\" than
when the dog was killed when no one was nearby to hear the barking. It
is also harder to imagine a different outcome if an actor's behavior is
viewed as out of his control than when it is controllable. For example,
to the extent that people accept the stereotype of a rapist as being
\"sex-starved, insane, or both,\" they have a hard time imagining him
behaving differently and refraining from his attack on the victim.\"6
Taken as a whole\--and as unrealistic and inaccurate as they may
sometimes be---our scripts, schemas, and prototypes of discrimination
lead us to take for granted and thus to accept in- equitable outcomes.
And by incorporating the assumptions implicit in these conceptions of
discrimination, [the legal model of intentional discrimination
reinforces and institutionalizes this effect]{.underline}. [We
come,]{.underline} in other words, [to view members of certain groups as
appropriate or acceptable targets for the kinds of mistreatment that we
are used to seeing them suffer]{.underline}. Even those of us who are
vulnerable to common forms of discrimination may adopt this perspective
to some degree, as we shall see below. Those who do not see themselves
as likely targets of discrimination, on the other hand---that is,
members of typically dominant groups---may even find comfort in these
patterns. One of the less noble tendencies of human beings is to gauge
our own vulnerability to negative events by comparison to others---and
to prefer to compare \"down- ward," to less fortunate others. Downward
social comparison gives us a favorable, self-enhancing view of
ourselves, thereby reducing anxiety and improving our sense of
well-being.47 Accordingly, individuals who can distinguish themselves
from potential targets are able to reap psychological benefits from
drawing that distinction. To the extent that racially discriminatory
patterns of mistreatment provide nontarget individuals with more
vulnerable, less fortunate groups with which to compare themselves,
these patterns also provide nontarget persons with a means of enhancing
their positive views of themselves and the world---to see the world as
safe and just and themselves as invulnerable and worthy. To the extent
that viewing some groups as expected, even accepted, [targets for
mistreatment provides a nontarget individual with a way of
differentiating herself from that victim, she may feel even more
insulated from or immune to such treatment because her group identity
protects her. The comfort that comes from seeing others as more
vulnerable than ourselves in turn serves to reinforce the designation of
those others as suitable victims]{.underline}.48

Extend Wang, 02 -- utilitarianism perpetuates the exclusion of the
marginalized. This reinforces systematic bias based on race, class, and
gender for the benefit of a privileged class. The normality of
discrimination produces a feedback loop where our reaction to suffering
is muted and our biased judgments reinforce the norms that contributed
to discrimination in the first place. These biases distort perceptions
of cause and effect and our evaluation of the events in question. Once
we are accustomed to the systematic harm of disadvantaged individuals it
makes it possible to ignore their suffering while overestimating the
impact of events that threaten to change the social order.

We live in both a risk society (Beck 1992) and an exclusive society
(Young 1999). [At the same time as we orient to ourselves around the
risks and dangers which we see surrounding us in our everyday lives, so
also do our social and political arrangements lend themselves to the
magnification of inequalities in access to those goods which reassure,
protect or expose ourselves to risk]{.underline}. [As our perception of
the 'bads' increases, so do we seek to gamer the 'goods' which would
keep them at bay, trading on our capital reserves and capacities across
the various spheres of economy, community and culture]{.underline}. [The
'ontological insecurity']{.underline} which the condition of late
modernity inspires in us (Giddens 1990; Young 1999) [fuses with the
apprehension of mundane insecurities, pressuring us to invest in the
means of risk avoidance]{.underline} (Hope and Sparks 2000). As we feel
increasingly that the public sphere alone can no longer guarantee
sufficiently the public goods of everyday safety (see Garland 1996), so
we are thrown upon our own individual and collective resources and
strategies to acquire the private goods which would remedy our perceived
security deficit. And our incapacity to protect ourselves from risk
leads to frustration with government - still seen as the primary g
provider of safety in modem society --- and with ourselves, as a
reflection of our own powerlessness in the face of the risks and harms
that surround us. Yet, access to capital in one sphere - for instance.
through income and of such a process is at work in contemporary society
we might expect to see consequences in observed structure of outcomes --
both of risk and of risk avoidance. Even if we have little access to the
decision making processes of individuals, and little chance of observing
their pursuit of strategies of risk avoidance in their everyday lives,
we may still be able to infer their operation from the observed
structural patterns of risk. In this vein, this chapter essays an
"actuarial" analysis of the distribution of the risk to private citizens
of household property crime victimization in England and Wales, as
measured by the British Crime Survey.

against traditionally subordinated concepts (such as ' multiculturalism

vein, bell hooks argues that [not only must the black life experience be

\"vestiges of internalized racism.\"211 Those [vestiges include: the
belief among white Americans, which perpetuates the exercise of white
privilege, that they are not responsible for racism]{.underline}; their
belief that black people should be feared and dreaded; the belief among

economic necessity of the repression of black rage directed toward

Up to this point, I have tried to demonstrate that [transnational
socio-political relations are nurturing a thriving culture and
infrastructure of prevention from below, which challenges presumptions
about the inscrutability of the future (II) and a stance of indifference
toward it]{.underline} (III). Nonetheless, unless and until it is
substantively 'filled in,' the argument is vulnerable to
misappropriation since [farsightedness does not in and of itself ensure
emancipatory outcomes]{.underline}. Therefore, this section proposes to
specify normative criteria and participatory procedures through which
citizens can determine the 'reasonableness,' legitimacy, and
effectiveness of competing dystopian visions in order to arrive at a
socially self-instituting future. [Foremost among the possible
distortions of farsightedness is alarmism, the manufacturing of
unwarranted and unfounded doomsday scenarios. State and market
institutions may seek to produce a culture of fear by deliberately
stretching interpretations of reality beyond the limits of the plausible
so as to exaggerate the prospects of impending
catastrophes]{.underline}, or yet again, by intentionally promoting
certain prognoses over others for instrumental purposes. Accordingly,
[regressive dystopias can operate as Trojan horses advancing political
agendas or commercial interests that would otherwise be susceptible to
public scrutiny and opposition. Instances of this kind of manipulation
of the dystopian imaginary are plentiful: the invasion of Iraq in the
name of fighting terrorism and an imminent threat of use of 'weapons of
mass destruction']{.underline}; the severe curtailing of American civil
liberties amidst fears of a collapse of 'homeland security'; the
neoliberal dismantling of the welfare state as the only remedy for an
ideologically constructed fiscal crisis; [the conservative expansion of
policing and incarceration due to supposedly spiraling crime waves; and
so forth. Alarmism constructs and codes the future in particular ways,
producing or reinforcing certain crisis narratives, belief structures,
and rhetorical conventions. As much as alarmist ideas beget a culture of
fear, the reverse is no less true.]{.underline}

## Moral conscience precedes rational decision making -- decisions are based off a moral backdrop {#moral-conscience-precedes-rational-decision-making-decisions-are-based-off-a-moral-backdrop .Tags}

> **Bauman,** Emeritus Prof of Sociology at the University of Leeds**,
> 1993**

> (Zygmunt, *Postmodern Ethics*, 246-250)

But the moral crisis of the postmodern habitat requires first and
foremost that politics - whether the politics of the politicians or the
policentric, scattered politics which matters all the more for being so
elusive and beyond control \_ be an extension and institutionalization
of moral responsibility. Genuine moral issues of the high-tech world are
by and large beyond the reach of individuals (who, at best, may singly
or severally purchase the right not to worry about them, or buy a
temporary reprieve from suffering the effects of neglect). The effects
of technology are long-distance, and so must be the preventive and
remedial action. Hans Jonas\'s \'long-range ethics\' makes sense, if at
all, only as a political programme - though given the nature of the
postmodern habitat, there is little hope that any political party
competing for state power would be willing, suicidally, to endorse this
truth and act upon it. Commenting on Edgar Allan Poe\'s story of three
fishermen caught in the maelstrom, of whom two died paralysed with fear
and doing nothing, but the third survived, having noticed that round
objects are sucked into the abyss less quickly, and promptly jumping
into a barrel - Norbert Elias sketched the way in which the exit from a
nonexit situation may be plotted. The survivor, Elias suggests, "began
to think more coolly; and by standing back, by controlling his own fear,
by seeing himself as it were from a distance, like a chessman forming a
pattern with others -on a board, he managed to turn his thoughts
away from himself to the situation in which he found himself\...
Symbolically representing in his mind the structure and direction of the
flow of events, he discovered a way of escape. In that situation, the
level of self-control and the level of process-control were \...
interdependent and complemen tary.\'s" Let us note that Poe\'s cool and
clever fisherman escaped alone. We do not know how many barrels there
were left in the boat. And barrels, after all, have been known since
Diogenes to be the ultimate individual retreats. The question is - and
to this question private cunning offers no answer \-- to what extent the
techniques of individual survival (techniques by the way, amply provided
for all present and future, genuine and putative maelstroms, by
eager-tooblige-and-profit merchants of goods and counsels) can be
stretched to-embrace the-collective survival.\--The-maelstrom-of the
kind we are in - all of us together, and most of us individually - is so
frightening because of its tendency to break down the issue of common
survival into a sackful of individual survival issues, and then to take
the issue so pulverized off the political agenda. Can the process be
retraced? Can that which has been broken be made whole again? And where
to find an adhesive strong enough to keep it whole? If the successive
chapters of this book suggest anything, it is that moral issues cannot
be \'resolved\', nor the moral life of humanity guaranteed, by the
calculating and legislative efforts of reason. Morality is not safe in
the hands of reason, though this is exactly what spokesmen of reason
promise. Reason cannot help the moral self without depriving the self of
what makes the self moral: that unfounded, non-rational, un-arguable,
no-excuses-given and noncalculable urge to stretch towards the other, to
caress, to be for, to live for, happen what may. Reason is about making
correct decisions, while moral responsibility precedes all thinking
about decisions as it does not, and cannot care about any logic which
would allow the approval of an action as correct. Thus, morality can be
\`rationalized\' only at the cost of self-denial and self attrition.
From that reason assisted self-denial, the self emerges morally
disarmed, unable (and unwilling) to face up to the multitude of moral
challenges and cacophony of ethical prescriptions. At the far end of the
long march of reason, moral nihilism waits: that moral nihilism which in
its deepest essence means not the denial of binding ethical code, and
not the blunders of relativistic theory - but the loss of ability to be
moral. As far as the doubts in the ability of reason to legislate the
morality of human cohabitation are concerned, the blame cannot be laid
at the doorstep of the postmodern tendency to dismiss the orthodox
philosophical programme. The most pronounced manifestations of
programmatic or resigned - moral relativism can be found in the writings
of thinkers who reject and resent postmodern verdicts and voice doubts
as to the very existence of a postmodern perspective, let alone the
validity of judgements allegedly passed from its vantage point. Apart
from value-signs added (often as an afterthought), there is little to
choose between ostensibly \'anti-postmodern, scientific recordings of
the ways and means of \`embedded selves\', and the enough space and
enough time. There is little disagreement between them as to the
assumption - authenticated by the long managerial efforts of modern
times and the realities of the social habitat these efforts managed to
produce - that in order to act morally the person must first be disowned
of autonomy, whether by coercive or purchasable expertise; and as to
another assumption (which also reflects the realities of the
contemporary modee of life), that the roots of action are likely to be
assessed as moral, and the criteria to assess the morality of acts, must
be extrinsic to the actor. There is little difference between two
ostensibly opposite standpoints in the way they disallow or neglect the
possibility that it may be precisely the expropriation of moral
prerogatives and the usurpation of moral competence by agencies
extrinsic to the moral self (multiple agencies, contestant and
combative, yet equally vociferous in their claims to ethical
infallibility) which stand behind the stubborn unassailability of
ethical relativism and moral nihilism. There is little reason to trust
the assurances of the expropriating/ usurping agencies that the fate of
morality is safe with them; there is little evidence that this has been
the case thus far, and little encouragment can be derived from the
scrutiny of their present work for the hope that this will be more of
the case in the future. At the end of the ambitious modern project of
universal moral certainty, of legislating the morality of and for human
selves, of replacing the erratic and unreliable moral impulses with a
socially underwritten ethical code - the bewildered and disoriented self
finds itself alone in the face of moral dilemmas without good (let alone
obvious) choices, unresolved moral conflicts and the excruciating
difficulty of being moral. Fortunately for humanity (though not always
for the moral self) .and despite all the expert efforts to the contrary,
the moral conscience - that ultimate prompt of moral impulse and root of
moral responsibility \-\--has.only been anaesthesized not amputated, It
is still there, dormant perhaps, often stunned, sometimes shamed into
silence - but capable of being awoken, of that Levinas\'s feat of
sobering up from inebriated torpor. The moral conscience commands
obedience without proof that the command should be obeyed; conscience
can neither convince nor coerce. Conscience wields none of the weapons
recognized by the modern world as insignia of authority. By the
standards which support the modern world, conscience is weak. The
proposition that conscience of the moral self is humanity\'s only
warrant and hope may strike the modern mind as preposterous; if not
presposterous, then portentous: what chance\_ for a morality having
conscience (already dismissed by the authority-conscious mind as fickle,
\`merely subjective\', a freak) for its sole foundation? And yet..
. Summing up the moral lessons of the Holocaust, Hannah Arendt demanded
"that human beings be capable of telling right from wrong even when all
they have to guide them is their own judgment, which, moreover, happens
to be completely at odds with what they must regard as the
unanimous opinion of all these around them\... These few who were still
able to tell right from wrong went really only by their own judgments,
and they did so freely; there were no rules to be abided by\... because
no rules existed for the unprecedented.\" What we know for sure is that
curing ostensible feebleness of moral conscience left the moral self, as
a rule, disarmed in the face of the  \`unanimous opinion of all these
around them\', and their elected or self-appointed spokesmen; while the
power which that unanimous opinion wielded was in no way a guarantee of
its ethical value. Knowing this, we have little choice but to place our
bet on that conscience which, however wan, alone can instil the
responsibility for disobeying the command to do evil. Contrary to one of
the most uncritically accepted philosophical axioms, there is no
contradiction between the rejection of (or scepticism towards) the
ethics of socially conventionalized and rationally \`founded\' norms,
and the insistence that it does matter, and matter morally, what we do
and from what we desist. Far from excluding each other, the two can be
accepted or rejected only together. If in doubt - consult your
conscience.

Daniel Callahan, Co-founder and former director of The Hastings
Institute, PhD in philosophy from Harvard University, "The Tyranny of
Survival" 1973, p 91-93

[There seems to be no imaginable evil which some group is not willing to
inflict on another for the sake of survival]{.underline}, no rights,
liberties or dignities which it is not ready to suppress. It is easy, of
course, to recognize the danger when survival is falsely and
manipulatively invoked. Dictators never talk about their aggressions,
but only about the need to defend the fatherland, to save it from
destruction at the hands of its enemies. But [my point]{.underline} goes
deeper than that. It [is directed]{.underline} even [at a legitimate
concern for survival, when that concern is allowed to reach an intensity
which would ignore, suppress, or destroy other fundamental human rights
and values. The potential tyranny of survival]{.underline} as a value is
that it [is capable]{.underline}, if not treated sanely, [of wiping out
all other values, Survival can become an obsession and a disease,
provoking a destructive singlemindedness that will stop at
nothing. ]{.underline}We come here to the fundamental moral dilemma. If,
both biologically and psychologically, the need for survival is basic to
man, and if survival is the precondition for any and all human
achievements, and if no other rights make much sense without the premise
of a right to life- then how will it be possible to honor and act upon
the need for survival, without in the process, destroying everything in
human beings which makes them worthy of survival? To put it more
strongly**, **[if the price of survival is human degradation, then there
is no moral reason why an effort should be made to ensure that survival.
It would be the Pyrrhic victory to end all Pyrrhic
victories]{.underline} Yet it would be the defeat of all defeats if,
because human beings could not properly manage their need to survive,
they succeeded in not doing so.

However, its strengths are also its weaknesses. Its quantifications
techniques are far from being simple, straightforward, and objective.
Indeed, they are often too complicated to be practical. They are also to
flexible and subject to manipulation. They are impersonal and lack
compassion. More importantly, they fail to deal the issue of equity and
distributive justice. Seemingly, you cannot get fairer than this. In
calculating benefits and costs, each person is counted as one and only
one. IN other words, people are treated equally. For Mill, "justice
arises from the principle of utility". Utilitarianism in concerted only
the aggregate effect, no matter how the aggregate is distributed. For
almost all policies, there is an uneven distribution of benefits and
costs. Some people win, while others lose. The Pareto optimality would
is almost nonexistent. A policy's outcome is Pareto optimal if nobody
loses and at least one person gains.

[A problem with utilitarian ethics is that the principle of the greatest
good for the greatest number could entail that some species are
disadvantaged or actively exterminated]{.underline}. Firstly, [the
utilitarian calculus]{.underline} of the greatest good for the greatest
number [is very difficult when it is restricted to
humanit]{.underline}y. [The present satisfaction of a portion of
humanity]{.underline}, let alone all of humanity, [is very difficult to
evaluate and the different degrees of satisfaction to be had by various
people from various sources of satisfaction is very difficult to
predict,]{.underline} so the determination of the greatest good for the
greatest number after the distribution of limited resources is very,
very difficult to evaluate. As applied to all sentient species, [it is
virtually impossible to evaluate]{.underline}, since it is very
difficult to know the feelings of sentient animals other than people.
Secondly, [utilitarianism can lead to significant inequalities in the
distribution of limited resources]{.underline}. For example, among a
group of people with 50 units of satisfaction there could be a small
group with about 80 units of satisfaction and another larger group with
about 40 units of satisfaction, since the small group have exclusive
control of some equipment. According to utilitarianism, another 10 units
of satisfaction should be distributed to the small group when it can use
its equipment to transform 10 units of simple satisfaction into 20 units
of added value satisfaction. [Assuming that it is possible to know the
feelings of sentient animals, a sentient species]{.underline} (e.g., a
predator) [that inflicts pain on another sentient species should be
disadvantaged or extinguished when the satisfaction of that species is
less than the satisfaction of the species that suffer pai]{.underline}n.
Thus, [although the utilitarian principle may apply to all sentient
species, the difficulties of utilitarianism are insurmountable or the
inequalities implied by utilitarianism are likely to promote the
extinction of species]{.underline}.

[Not only does Utilitarianism lack a device for reducing the
infringement of its rules, but because its rules are very demanding,
many utilitarian writers go in the opposite direction and accord moral
agents some freedom in the implementation of its rules]{.underline}.
According to Harsanyi (1985, p. 46) supererogation may be accommodated
into Rule Utilitarianism by permitting the moral agent free choice
between two acts A and B. The [moral agent may carry out the act with
the lower total utility as long as the difference between the ensuing
utilities does not exceed a given amount]{.underline} (Cf. Scheffler\'s
idea referred to below).10 Some utilitarian writers have advocated
permissiveness following Williams\'s incisive criticism of
Utilitarianism. According to Williams (1973) [Utilitarianism is too
demanding in that it fails to give adequate recognition to a person\'s
own projects which give meaning to his life, and impose upon him
responsibility for maximizing the good]{.underline}. Because of the need
to make Utilitarianism more permissive, it would be contradictory to
require that at the same time it be made more severe.

[The very notion of prediction does, by its own logic, annihilate human
agency. To assert that international relations is]{.underline} a domain
of political dynamics whose future should be [predictable]{.underline}
through a convincing set of theoretical propositions [is to assume that
the source of global politics is to a certain extent
predetermined]{.underline}. From such a vantage-point, there is no more
room for interference and human agency, no more possibility for politics
to overtake theory. [A predictive app roach thus runs the risk of ending
up in a form of inquiry that imposes a static image upon a far more
complex set of transversal political practices]{.underline}. The point
of a theoretical inquiry, however, is not to ignore the constantly
changing domain of internationals relations. Rather, the main objective
must consists of facilitating and hindering of transversal struggles
that can grapple with those moment when people walk through walls
precisely when nobody expects them to do so. [Prediction is a
problematic assessment tool]{.underline} even if a theory is able to
anticipate future events. Important theories, such as [realist
interpretations of international politics, may well predict certain
events only because their theoretical premises have become so
objectivised that they have started to shape decision makers and
political dynamics]{.underline}. Dissent, in this case, is the process
that reshapes these entrenched perceptions and the ensuing political
practices. Describing, explaining and prescribing may be less
unproblematic processes of evaluation, but only at first sight. If one
abandons the notion of Truth, the idea that an event can be apprehended
as part of a natural order, authentically and scientifically, as
something that exists independently of the meaning we have given it --
if one abandons this separation of object and subject, then the process
of judging a particular approach to describing and explaining an event
becomes a very muddles affair[. There is no longer an objective
measuring device that can set the standard to evaluate whether or not a
particular insight into an event]{.underline}, such as the collapse of
the Berlin Wall, [is true or false. The very nature of a past event
becomes indeterminate]{.underline} insofar [as its identification is
dependent upon ever-changing forms of linguistic expression that imbue
the event with meaning. 56]{.underline}

## The calculation of utilitarianism is the foundation of totalitarianism

George Kateb, Professor of Politics, Princeton, THE INNER OCEAN, 1992,
p. 11

I do not mean to take seriously the idea that utilitarianism is a
satisfactory replacement for the theory of rights. [The
well-being]{.underline} (or mere preferences) [of the majority cannot
override the rightful claims of individuals]{.underline}. In a time when
the theory of rights is global it is noteworthy that some moral
philosophers disparage the theory of rights. [The political experience
of this century should be enough to make them hesitate]{.underline}: it
is not clear that, say, some version of [utilitarianism
could]{.underline} not justify [totalitarian evil. It also could be
fairly easy for some utilitarians to justify any war and any
dictatorship, and very easy to justify any kind of ruthless-ness even in
societies that pay some attention to rights. There is no end to the
immoral permissions that]{.underline} one or another type of
[utilitarianism grants]{.underline}. [Everything is permitted, if the
calculation is right]{.underline}. No, [an advocate of rights cannot
take utilitarianism seriously as a competing general theory of political
morality]{.underline}, nor any other competing general theory. [Rather,
particular principles or considerations must be given a
place]{.underline}. A theory of rights may simply leave many decisions
undetermined or have to admit that rights may have to be overridden (but
never for the sake of Social well-being or mere policy preference).
Also, kinds of rights may sometimes conflict, and it is not always
possible to end that conflict either by an elaboration of the theory of
rights or by an appeal to some other

## Every alternative to rights leads to tyranny

George **Kateb**, Professor of Politics, Princeton, THE INNER OCEAN,

At the same time, there are other theories that seem to affirm human
dignity yet give rights only a lesser or probationary or instrumental
role. Examples are utilitarianism, recent communitarianism, recent
republicanism, and radical egalitarianism. The first and last 1 will
return to shortly; my response to the others appears here and there in
this volume. (All I wish to say now is that [unless rights come first
they are not rights. They will tend to be sacrificed to some purpose
deemed higher than the equal dignity of every individual. There will be
little if any concept of the integrity or inviolability of each
individual. The group or the majority or the good or the sacred or the
vague future will be preferred. The beneficiaries will be victimized
along with the victims because no one is being treated as a person who
is irreplaceable and beyond value. To make rights anything but
primary,]{.underline} even though in the name of human dignity, [is to

## Government coercion must be morally rejected

Dr. Edward **Younkins**, business professor, Wheeling Jesuit, CIVIL
SOCIETY: THE REALM OF FREEDOM," June 10, **2000**, p.
http://www.quebecoislibre.org/000610-11.htm

Recently (and ironically), government projects and programs have been
started to restore civil society through state subsidization or coercive
mandates. Such [coercion cannot create true voluntary associations.
Statists who support such projects believe only in the power of
political society -- they don\'t realize that the subsidized or mandated
activity can be performed voluntarily through the private interaction of
individuals and associations. They also don\'t understand that to
propose that an activity not be performed coercively, **is** not to
oppose the activity, but simply its coercion.]{.underline} [If civil
society is to be revived, we must substitute voluntary cooperation for
coercion and replace mandates with the rule of law.]{.underline}
According to the Cato Handbook for Congress, Congress should: before
trying to institute a government program to solve a problem, investigate
whether there is some other government program that is causing the
problem \... and, if such a program is identified, begin to reform or
eliminate it; ask by what legal authority in the Constitution Congress
undertakes an action \...; recognize that [when government undertakes a
program, it displaces the voluntary efforts of others and makes
voluntary association in civil society appear redundant, with
significant negative effects;]{.underline} and begin systematically to
abolish or phase out those government programs that do what could be
accomplished by voluntary associations in civil society \... recognizing
that [accomplishment through free association is morally superior to
coercive mandates, and almost always generates more efficient
outcomes.]{.underline} [Every time taxes are raised, another regulation
is passed, or another government program is adopted, we are
acknowledging the inability of individuals to govern themselves. It
follows that there is a moral imperative for us to reclaim our right to
live in a civil society, rather than to have bureaucrats and politicians
« solve » our problems and run our lives.]{.underline}

## Consequentialism, by very nature, will fail in public policy to improve the well-being of others {#consequentialism-by-very-nature-will-fail-in-public-policy-to-improve-the-well-being-of-others .Tags}

**Scheffler, prof philosophy, Princeton, 94**

(Samuel Scheffler, prof philosophy, Princeton, 11/24/94, [The Rejection
of Consequentialism]{.underline}, p. 14-16,
http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=M95w6e9pzZsC&oi=fnd&pg=PA14&dq=reject+consequentialism&ots=hbQFBohbTL&sig=VgDh7pP6sAhJ1IKGaBA3BW7hi1Y)

I will maintain shortly that a hybrid theory which departed from
consequentialism only to the extent of incorporating an agent-centred
prerogative could accommodate the objection dealing with personal
integrity. But first it is necessary to give fuller characterization of
a plausible prerogative of this kind. To avoid confusion, it is
important to make a sharp distinction at the outset between an
agent-centred prerogative and a consequentialist dispensation to devote
more attention to one's own happiness and well-being than to the
happiness and well-being of others. Consequentialists often argue that a
differential attention to one's own concerns will in most actual
circumstances have the best overall results, and that such differential
treatment of oneself is therefore required on consequentialist grounds.
Two sorts of considerations are typically appealed to in support of this
view. First, it is said that one is in a better position to promote
one's own welfare and the welfare of those one is closest to than to
promote the welfare of other people. So an agent produces maximum good
per unit of activity by focusing his efforts on those he is closest to,
including himself. Second, it is said that human nature being what it
is, people cannot function effectively at all unless they devote
somewhat more energy to promoting their own well-being than to promoting
the well-being of other people. Here the appeal is no longer to the
immediate consequantialist advantages of promoting one's own well-being,
but rather to the long-term advantages of having psychologically healthy
agents who are efficient producers of the good. We find an example of
the first type of argument in Sidgwick's remark that 'each man is better
able to provide for his own happiness than for that of other persons,
from his more intimate knowledge of his own desires and needs, and his
greater opportunities of gratifying them.' Mill, in the same vein,
writes that 'the occasions on which any person (except one in a
thousand) has it in his power...to be a public benefactor -- are but
exceptional; and on these occasions alone is he called on to consider
public utility; in every other case, private utility, the interest or
happiness of some few persons, is all he has to attend to.' Sidgwick
suggests an argument of the second type when he says that because 'it is
under the stimulus of self-interest that the active energies of most men
are most easily and thoroughly drawn out', it would 'not under actual
circumstances promote the universal happiness if each man were to
concern himself with the happiness of others as much as with his own.'

Consequentialism claims that an act is morally permissible if and only
if it has better consequences than those of any available alternative
act. This means that agents are morally required to make their largest
possible contribution to the overall good-no matter what the sacrifice
to them- selves might involve (remembering only that their own
well-being counts too). There is no limit to the sacrifices that
morality can require; and agents are never permitted to favor their own
interests at the expense of the greater good.

Our ordinary moral intuitions rebel at this picture. We want to claim
that there is a limit to what morality can require of us. Some
sacrifices for the sake of others are meritorious, but not required;
they are super- erogatory. Common morality grants the agent some room to
pursue his own projects, even though other actions might have better
consequences: we are permitted to promote the good, but we are not
required to do so. The objection that consequentialism demands too much
is accepted uncritically by almost all of us; most moral philosophers
introduce per- mission to perform nonoptimal acts without even a word in
its defense. But the mere fact that our intuitions support some moral
feature hardly constitutes in itself adequate philosophical
justification. If we are to go beyond mere intuition mongering, we must
search for deeper foundations. We must display the reasons for limiting
the requirement to pursue the good.

Furthermore, discussions of the claim that consequentialism demands too
much are often undermined by failure to distinguish this claim from the
widely discussed objection that consequentialism permits too much-
improperly permitting sacrifices to be imposed on some for the sake of
others. Some theories include deontological restrictions, forbidding
certain kinds of acts even when the consequences would be good. I will
not consider here the merits of such restrictions. It is important to
note, however, that even a theory which included such restrictions might
still lack more general permission to act nonoptimally-requiring agents
to promote the good within the pennissible means. It is only the grounds
for rejecting such a general requirement to promote the overall good
that we will examine here.

However, its strengths are also its weaknesses. Its quantifications
techniques are far from being simple, straightforward, and objective.
Indeed, they are often too complicated to be practical. They are also to
flexible and subject to manipulation. They are impersonal and lack
compassion. More importantly, they fail to deal the issue of equity and
distributive justice. Seemingly, you cannot get fairer than this. In
calculating benefits and costs, each person is counted as one and only
one. IN other words, people are treated equally. For Mill, "justice
arises from the principle of utility". Utilitarianism in concerted only
the aggregate effect, no matter how the aggregate is distributed. For
almost all policies, there is an uneven distribution of benefits and
costs. Some people win, while others lose. The Pareto optimality would
is almost nonexistent. A policy's outcome is Pareto optimal if nobody
loses and at least one person gains.

Besides these ridiculous policy implications in the United States and in
the world, the logic underlying Summers' proposal represents "cultural
imperialism," the capitalist mode of production and consumption, and "a
particular kind of political-economic power and its discriminatory
practices" (Harvey 1996:368). Except for its beautiful guise of economic
logic, the proposal is nothing new to those familiar with the history.
The capitalistic powerhouses in Europe practiced material and cultural
imperialism against countries in Africa, America, and Asia for years.
They did it by raising the banner of trade and welfare enhancement. They
did it through guns and powder. Of course, they had their logic for
exporting opium to Canton (Guangzhou) in China through force. Now, we
see a new logic. This time, it is economic logic and globalization. This
time, the end is the same, but the means is not through guns and powder.
Instead, it is political-economic power. This example illustrates
clearly the danger of using the utilitarian perspective as the only
means for policy analysis. Fundamentally, the utilitarian disregards the
distributive justice issue altogether and espouses the current mode of
production and consumption and the political-economic structure, without
any attention to the inequity and inequality in the current system. Even
worse and more subtly, it delivers the philosophy of "it exists,
therefore it's good." However, "just because it sells, doesn't mean we
have to worship it" (Peirce 1991).

Economics at Birmingham-Southern College, The Failure of Utilitarian

A final problem with utilitarianism that ought to be mentioned is that
it is subject to being criticized because of a potential fallacy of
composition. The common good is not necessarily the sum of the interests
of individuals. In their book, *A History of Economic Theory and
Method*, Ekelund and Hebert provide a well-conceived example to
demonstrate this problem. They write: It is presumably in the general
interest of American society to have every automobile in the United
States equipped with all possible safety devices. However, a majority of
individual car buyers may not be willing to pay the cost of such
equipment in the form of higher auto prices. In this case, the
collective interest does not coincide with the sum of the individual
interests. The result is a legislative and economic dilemma. Indeed,
individuals prone to political action, and held under the sway of
utilitarian ethics, will likely be willing to decide in favor of the
supposed collective interest over and against that of the individual.
But then, what happens to individual human rights? Are they not
sacrificed and set aside as unimportant? In fact, this is precisely what
has happened. In democratic countries the destruction of human liberty
that has taken place in the past hundred years has occurred primarily
for this reason. In addition, such thinking largely served as the
justification for the mass murders of millions of innocent people in
communist countries where the leaders sought to establish the "workers'
paradise." To put the matter simply, utilitarianism offers no cohesive
way to discern between the various factions competing against one
another in political debates and thus fails to provide an adequate guide
for ethical human action. The failure of utilitarianism at this point is
extremely important for a whole host of policy issues. Among them, the
issue of the government's provision of public goods is worth our
consideration.

Indeed, the widespread confusion over this point is one of the primary
reasons why western market economies have continued to drift towards the
ready acceptance of socialist policies. Edmund Opitz has rightly
observed that utilitarianism with its "greatest happiness principle"
completely neglects the spiritual dimension of human life. Rather, it
simply "asserts that men are bound together in societies solely on the
basis of a rational calculation of the private advantage to be gained by
social cooperation under the division of
labor."[^\[2\]^](http://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=1602#_ftn2)
But, as Opitz shows, this perspective gives rise to a serious problem.
Since theft is the first labor saving device, the utilitarian principle
will tend to lead to the collective use of government power so as to
redistribute income in order to gain the "greatest happiness" in
society. Regrettably, the rent seeking behavior that is spawned as a
result of this mind set will prove detrimental to the economy.
Nevertheless, this kind of action will be justified as that which is
most socially expedient in order to reach the assumed ethical end.
"Utilitarianism, in short, has no logical stopping place short of
collectivism."[\[3\]](http://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=1602#_ftn3)
If morality is ultimately had by making the individual's happiness
subservient to the organic whole of society, which is what Bentham's
utilitarianism asserts, then the human rights of the individual may be
violated. That means property rights may be violated if it is assumed to
promote the utilitarian end. However, property rights are essential in
securing a free market order. As a result, utilitarianism can then be
used to justify some heinous government actions. For instance, the
murder of millions of human beings can be justified in the minds of
reformers if it is thought to move us closer to paradise on earth. This
is precisely the view that was taken by communist revolutionaries as
they implemented their grand schemes of remaking society. All of this is
not to say that matters of utility are unimportant in policy decisions,
but merely to assert that utilitarian ethics will have the tendency of
promoting collectivist policies.

Furthermore, abandoning the principle of human equality could lead to
eugenics because eugenics is founded on the same philosophy that some
people are of lesser value than others. Eugenics is founded on the
utilitarian philosophy of German philosopher Hegel. Utilitarianism, also
known as pragmatism, holds that \"the end justifies the means.\" If a
means provides a solution to a practical problem, it is morally
justifiable.{86} The Holocaust, in which Nazi Germany saw a problem in
the existence of Jews, Gypsies, and mentally and physically handicapped
people, was founded on Hegel's pragmatic philosophy.{87} C.G.
Campbell,{88} President of the American Eugenics Society Inc. in
1931{89} has written: \"Adolf Hitler \... guided by the nation\'s
anthropologists, eugenicists and social philosophers, has been able to
construct a comprehensive racial policy of population development and
improvement \... it sets a pattern \... these ideas have met stout
opposition in the Rousseauian social philosophy \... which bases \...
its whole social and political theory upon the patent fallacy of human
equality \... racial consanguinity occurs only through endogamous mating
or interbreeding within racial stock \... conditions under which racial
groups of distinctly superior hereditary qualities \... have emerged.\"
(Emphasis added).{90} Mr. Campbell, a leader in the eugenics
movement,{91} has clearly rejected the idea of human equality. This
rejection helped pave the way toward intellectual acceptance of Nazi
Germany's \"Final Solution.\" and has helped pave the way toward
America's final solution to problem pregnancy. \"Nazi Germany used the
findings of eugenicists as the basis for the killing of people of
inferior genetic stock.\"{92} Another leader in the eugenics movement,
Madison Grant,{93} connected the purported inequality of the unborn to
the goals of the eugenics movement. \"\...Indiscriminate efforts to
preserve babies among the lower classes often results in serious injury
to the race \... Mistaken regard for what are believed to be divine laws
and sentimental belief in the sanctity of human life tend to prevent
both the elimination of defective infants and the sterilization of such
adults as are themselves of no value to the community\" (Emphasis
added).{94} As recently as six years ago, two medical ethicists, Kuhse
and Singer, have argued that no human being has any right to life.{95}
Using a utilitarian approach, they have concluded that \"mentally
defective\" people, unborn people, and even children before their first
birthday, have no right to life because these people are not in full
possession of their faculties.{96} These utilitarian authors are fully
consistent with other utilitarians in that they first reject the
principle that are humans have equal moral status, then, using
subjective criteria that appeals to themselves personally, they identify
certain humans they find expendable. While Kuhse and Singer may be
personally comfortable with their conclusions, this approach leaves all
of us less than secure from being dehumanized. If newborn infants can be
found to lack equal moral status, then surely there are other innocent
and vulnerable member of society who can be similarly found to lack
equal moral status. The Nazis left few people in Germany safe from the
gas chambers, and any other society that uses utilitarianism in medical
ethics also leaves great portions of society at risk of death at the
convenience of society at large. Clearly, the equal moral status of all
humans must be recognized by the law.

Another problem with utilitarianism is that it has a very narrow
conception of what it means to be a human being. Within Bentham's view,
human beings are essentially understood to be passive creatures who
respond to the environment in a purely mechanical fashion. As such,
there are no "bad" motives, only "bad" calculations. In these terms, no
person is responsible for his or her own behavior. In effect, the idea
being promoted is that human action is essentially the same as that of a
machine in operation. This notion reduces a human thought to nothing
more than a series of bio-chemical reactions. Yet, if this is true, then
there is no meaning to human thought or human action and all human
reason is reduced to the point of being
meaningless.[^\[6\]^](http://www.independent.org/publications/article.asp?id=1602#_ftn6)

## Rights incompatible with utilitarianism. {#rights-incompatible-with-utilitarianism. .Tags}

**Brandt, professor of philosophy @ U Mich. 1992**

Richard. Morality, Utilitarianism, and Rights. Cambridge University
Press. Pg 196.

The first thing to notice is [that utilitarianism is a general normative
theory *either* about what is *desirable,* or about what conduct is
*morally right,* but in the first instance **not a theory of rights at
all**]{.underline}**,** except by implication. A philosopher can be a
utilitarian without offering any definition of \"a right\" and indeed
without having thought about the matter. [It is true that some
definitions of \"a right\" are so manifestly incompatible with the
normative theses of utilitarianism that it is clear that a utilitarian
could not admit that there are rights in that sense.]{.underline} For
instance, [if someone says that to have a right]{.underline} (life,
liberty) [is for some sort of thing to be secured to one absolutely,
though the heavens fall, and that this is a self-evident truth, then it
is pretty clear that a utilitarian will have no place for rights in his
sense.]{.underline} Again, if one follows Hobbes and says, \"Neither by
the word *right* is anything else signified, than that liberty which
every man hath to make use of his natural faculties according to right
reason,\" one is not going to be able to accept a utilitarian normative
theory , for [a utilitarian is not going to underwrite a man\'s absolute
liberty to pursue his own good according to his own
judgment.]{.underline}

Utilitarian theories usually present the view that they are capable of
accommodating the idea of legal rights, as well as providing a normative
theory about such rights, which Lyons calls "the legal rights inclusion
thesis" (Lyons, 1994: 150). On the other hand however, [utilitarian
theorists are sceptical of the idea of moral rights unsupported by legal
institutions, as such rights would then in certain circumstances
preclude the pursuit of the most utile course of action owing to their
"moral force, or normative force"]{.underline} (Lyons, 1994: 150).
Conversely, legal rights are seen as being compatible with utilitarian
goals as they are normatively neutral, being "morally defensible" (which
"entails the idea of a moral presumption in favour of respecting them")
only in so a far as they contribute to overall utility (Lyons, 1994:
150). The problem then, as conceived by Lyons, is whether or not
utilitarians can account for the moral force of legal rights (which
people are commonly regarded as having by rights theorists and
utilitarians alike), as: [although there are often utilitarian reasons
for respecting justified legal rights, these reasons are not equivalent
to the moral force of such rights, because they do not exclude direct
utilitarian arguments against exercising such rights or for interfering
with them]{.underline} (Lyons, 1994: 150). This being the case, [the
utilitarian finds herself in the uncomfortable position of having to
explain why rights ought to be bothered with at all, as if they may be
violated on an *ad hoc* basis to satisfy the demands of maximal utility,
then they seem as confusing on this scheme as natural or moral rights
are claimed to be. This then raises the question as to whether or not
utilitarianism can accommodate any rights at all, even
legal]{.underline} rights as its exponents claim it is able to do, in
its rule formulation at least. However, leaving this debate aside as it
exceeds the scope of this paper, an alternative approach, that of
"government house utilitarianism" (see Goodin, 1995: 27) is worth
considering as a possible means to a solution.

[There is a]{.underline} common [criticism of absolutism]{.underline}
[which]{.underline}, if sound, [could be taken to demonstrate its
irrationality. It is that the absolutist refuses to consider the details
of particular cases and insists instead on the automatic application of
a blanket rule]{.underline}; [he thus fails]{.underline}, it is said,
[to \'take each case on its merits\'.]{.underline} Now there may be
absolutist positions which are vulnerable to this kind of objection;
[for example]{.underline}, [the position that one is never justified in
taking a human life, whatever the circumstances]{.underline}. Someone
might reasonably object that [there are moral distinctions to be made
over which this view simply rides rough-shod.]{.underline} Someone may
kill a fellow human being in many different circumstances and for many
different reasons; for personal gain of some kind; [to put a loved one
out of his misery; in self-defence; in just war or
revolution]{.underline}; as retribution; [and so on]{.underline}. Surely
[it would be irrational]{.underline}, if not absurd, to insist on
[making the same moral judgment about all these cases]{.underline}.
However, even if this is correct, it is a count against only some
absolutist positions, not against all. It is commonly assumed that the
absolutist must operate with some highly general, exceptionless rules;
but this is not an accurate picture of the kind of absolutism of which I
have been speaking throughout this paper. I have spoken, not so much of
moral rules, but of specific moral notions, concepts, or
categories-murder, courage, cowardice, honesty, loyalty, etc.; and I
have maintained that these operate as fundamental in moral assessment,
in the sense that their applicability to a particular action will often
be morally decisive, and, for some of them, will always be so.14 Let us
consider the example of murder, which is a notion the applicability of
which to an action is always morally decisive. My absolutist claims, not
that killing can never be justified, but that murder can never be
justified; and he will not classify all cases of killing as cases of
murder. Thus [it is simply not true that he does not have to investigate
the details of a particular case; indeed it is only through such an
investigation that he can be in a position to decide whether or not the
action in question is properly classifiable as \'murder\']{.underline}.
Further-more, [he will take into account many features of the situation
not con-sidered relevant by the consequentialist,]{.underline} for
example, [the agent\'s motive for the killing.]{.underline} Indeed, [it
could be maintained that the consequentialist\'s claim to consider each
case \'on its merits\' is vitiated by his extremely restricted
conception of where these merits must lie. I maintain that it is he,
with his exclusive concentration upon consequences, who abstracts from
morally relevant features of particular cases]{.underline}. Again, this
is a point to which I will return. Thus, if readiness to pay attention
to the details of individual cases be a test of rationality, my
absolutist passes it with his colours flying rather more conspicuously
than those of the supporters of consequentialism; they, after all, have
theformula.

According to Rawls, then, the debate over distribution is essentially a
debate over whether we should or should not define the right as
maximizing the good. But is this an accurate characterization of the
debate? Utilitarians do, of course, believe that the right act maximizes
happiness, under some description of that good. And that requirement
does have potentially abhorrent **consequences.** But do utilitarians
believe that it is right because it maximizes happiness? Do they hold
that the maximization of the good defines the right, as teleological
theories are said to do? Let us see why Rawls believes they do. Rawls
says that utilitarianism is teleological (that is, defines the right as
the maximization of the good) because it generalizes from what is
rational in the one-person case to what is rational in many-person
cases. Since it is rational for me to sacrifice my present happiness to
increase my later happiness if doing so will maximize my happiness
overall, it is rational for society to sacrifice my current happiness to
increase someone else\'s happiness if doing so maximizes social welfare
overall. For utilitarians, utility-maximizing acts are right because
they are maximizing. It is because they are maximizing that they are
rational. Rawls objects to this generalization from the one-person to
the many person case because he believes that it ignores the
separateness of persons.? **[Although it is right and proper that I
sacrifice my present happiness for my later happiness if doing so will
increase my overall happiness, it is wrong to demand that I sacrifice my
present happiness to increase someone else\'s happiness. In the first
case, the trade-off occurs within one person\'s life, and the later
happiness compensates for my current sacrifice. In the second case, the
trade-off occurs across lives, and I am not compensated for my sacrifice
by the fact that someone else benefits. My good has simply been
sacrificed, and I have been used as a means to someone
else\'s]{.underline}** 2. John Rawls, A Theory ofJz\~stice(Cambridge:

Scott Gordon echoes this interpretation of utilitarianism when he says
that utilitarians adopt the view \"that \'society\' is an organic entity
and contend that its utility is the proper objective of social policy.\"
This view, he says, \"permits flirtation with the grossest form of
anti-individualistic social philosophy.\"4 This, then, is Rawls\'s major
example of a \"teleological\" theory which gives priority to the good
over the right. His rejection of the priority of the good, in this
context, is just the corollary of his affirmation of the separateness of
persons: promoting the well-being of the social organism cannot be the
goal from which people\'s rightful claims are derived, since there is no
socialorganism. Since individuals are distinct, they are ends in
themselves, not merely agents or representatives of the well-being of
the social organism. This is why Rawls believes that utilitarianism is
teleological, and why he believes that we should reject it in favor of a
deontological doctrine.

There is, however, another interpretation of utilitarianism, one that
seems more in line with Rawls\'s characterization of the debate. On this
second interpretation, maximizing the good is primary, and we count
individuals equally only because that maximizes value. **Our primary
duty is not to treat people as equals, but to bring about valuable
states of affairs.** Rawls on Teleology and Deontology As Bernard
Williams puts it, **people are viewed merely as locations of utilities,
or as causal levers for the \"utility network\": \"the basic bearer of
value for Utilitarianism is the state of affairs**. . . . as a
Utilitarian agent, I am just the representative of the satisfaction
system who happens to be near certain causal levers at a certain
time.\"Io Utilitarianism, on this view, is primarily concerned not with
persons, but with states of affairs. This second interpretation is not
merely a matter of emphasizing a different facet of the same theoretical
structure. Its distinctiveness becomes clear if we look at some
utilitarian discussions of population policy, like those of Jonathan
Glover and Derek Parfit. They ask whether we morally ought to double the
population, even if it means reducing each person\'s welfare by almost
half (since that will still increase overall utility). They think that a
policy of doubling the population is a genuine, if somewhat repugnant,
conclusion of utilitarianism. But it need not be if we view
utilitarianism as a theory of treating people as equals. Nonexistent
people have no claims-we have no moral duty to them to bring them into
the world. As John Broome says, \"one cannot owe anyone a duty to bring
her into existence, because failing in such a duty would not be failing
anyone.\"\" So what is the duty here, on the second interpretation?
**The duty is to maximize value, to bring about valuable states of
affairs, even if the effect is to make all existing persons worse off
than they otherwise would have been**. To put the difference another
way, if I fail to bring about the best state of affairs, by failing to
consider the interests of some group of people, for example, then I can
be criticized, on both interpretations, for failing to live up to my
moral duty as a utilitarian. But, on the second interpretation, those

**order to bring about an ends.**

Thomas **Donaldson**, **1995** (Prof. of Business Ethics at Georgetown
U, Ethics and International Affairs,

"International Deontology Defended: A Response to Russell Hardin", pg.
147-154)

The supposed "unrealism" of deontology also seems to lie behind Hardin's
concerns over nuclear deterrence. After noting that Kantians typically
have condemned the indiscriminate destruction implicit in a policy of
deterrence, he adds that "it therefore seemed \[to Kantians\] profoundly
immoral to destroy cities full of children merely for the sake of the
theory of deterrence." The word "seemed" is surprising. Shouldn't most
people, not only Kantians, be appalled by the prospect of destroying
cities full of children? To not be appalled, I submit, is the result of
either having been swept away by the morality of consequences or having
studied too much political science. It is noteworthy that the reason we
are appalled relies on a Kantian-style explanation. **If we were to
adopt an exclusive consequentialist view, if the ends were always
capable of justifying the means, then the death of millions of innocents
should be trivial---mere fluff in the face of moral truth.** The idea
that there are some things that should not be done is precisely a
deontological notion. **The idea that, no matter how powerful a
deterrent it may be, the strapping of babies to the front of tanks is
nonetheless wrong, cannot be understood entirely in consequentialist
terms.** It does not follow that the policy of nuclear deterrence is
wrong from the viewpoint of deontology. Some deontologists accept
nuclear deterrence while others do not. But deontologists insist
correctly that not only the assessment of the consequences, but an
assessment of the means used to achieve consequences, must be factored
into the moral evaluation of nuclear deterrence.

## Utilitarianism taken alone allows unjustified war; full weight must be given to {#utilitarianism-taken-alone-allows-unjustified-war-full-weight-must-be-given-to .Tags}

**deontological analysis in order to achieve the best policy option.**

Eric **Heinze** in **99** (assistant prof. of polisci @ University of
Oklahoma, Human Rights & Human Welfare,

"Waging War for Human Rights: Towards a Moral-Legal Theory of
Humanitarian Intervention",

http://www.du.edu/gsis/hrhw/volumes/2003/heinze-2003.pdf, p. 5)

By itself, this "**utilitarianism** of rights" test has serious problems
when employed as a threshold level of human suffering that triggers a
humanitarian intervention. This is because it **suggests that aggregate
human suffering is the only moral concern that should be addressed**
(Montaldi 1985: 135). If we are to accept the general presumption
against war as enshrined in Article 2 of the UN Charter, we do so
because of war's inherent destructiveness and its detrimental effect on
international security. The use of force, including humanitarian
intervention, will always result in at least some loss of life. The
principle of utility ameliorates this effect of intervention, but **once
an intervention is employed to halt such widespread suffering, a pure
utilitarian ethos would sanction the pursuit of this primary end**
(achieving the military and/or humanitarian objective) **without
exception**, so long as fewer people are killed than are rescued in an
intervention. **Not only does this reduce the moral relevance of the
individual, it opens up the door for aggression disguised as
humanitarian intervention, as long as there are individuals who are
suffering and dying within a state---even if their suffering is entirely
accidental**. Taken as part and parcel of the utilitarian framework,
therefore, military intervention must only be sanctioned when it is in
response to violations that are intentionally perpetrated Thus, as
Fernando Tesón eloquently explains in his chapter, "The Liberal Case for
Humanitarian Intervention**," the best case for humanitarian
intervention contains a deontological element**---that is, a principled
concern for the respectful treatment of individuals (not intentionally
or maliciously mistreating them)---as well as a consequentialist
one---the utilitarian requirement that interventions cause more good
than harm (Holzgrefe and Keohane: 114). **Consider NATO's intervention
in Kosovo, where a significant number of Serbian civilians were killed
by NATO bombs** in the process of coercing the Milosevic regime to stop
its ethnic cleansing of Kosovars. **Regardless of whether more lives
were saved than lost, in accidentally killing noncombatants, NATO was in
essence accepting the notion that human rights are not absolute. This is
despite the fact that such killing was done in order to save the lives
of other innocent civilians.**

## Policy decisions directed at maintaining human survival through whatever means will encourage genocide, war, and the destruction of moral values {#policy-decisions-directed-at-maintaining-human-survival-through-whatever-means-will-encourage-genocide-war-and-the-destruction-of-moral-values .Tags}

Callahan 73 -- Co-Founder and former director of The Hastings Institute,
PhD in philosophy from Harvard University (Daniel, "The Tyranny of
Survival", p 91-93)

The value of survival could not be so readily abused were it not for its
evocative power. But abused it has been. In [the name of survival, all
manner of social and political evils have been committed against the
rights of individuals, including the right to life. The purported
threat]{.underline} of Communist domination has for over two decades
[fueled the drive of militarists for ever-larger defense budgets, no
matter what the cost to other social needs.]{.underline} During World
War II, native Japanese-Americans were herded, without due process of
law, to detention camps. This policy was later upheld by the Supreme
Court in Korematsu v. United States (1944) in the general context that a
threat to national security can justify acts otherwise blatantly
unjustifiable. The [survival of the Aryan race was one of the official
legitimations of Nazism.]{.underline} Under the banner of survival, the
government of South Africa imposes a ruthless apartheid, heedless of the
most elementary human rights. The Vietnamese war has seen one of the
greatest of the many absurdities tolerated in the name of survival: the
destruction of villages in order to save them. But it is not only in a
political setting that survival has been evoked as a final and
unarguable value. [The main rationale]{.underline} B. F. [Skinner
offers]{.underline} in Beyond Freedom and Dignity [for the controlled
and conditioned society is the need for surviva]{.underline}l. For
Jacques Monod, in Chance and Necessity, survival requires that we
overthrow almost every known religious, ethical and political system. In
genetics, the survival of the gene pool has been put forward as
sufficient grounds for a forceful prohibition of bearers of offensive
genetic traits from marrying and bearing children. Some have even
suggested that we do the cause of survival no good by our misguided
medical efforts to find means by which those suffering from such common
genetically based diseases as diabetes can live a normal life, and thus
procreate even more diabetics. In the field of population and
environment, one can do no better than to cite Paul Ehrlich, whose works
have shown a high dedication to survival, and in its holy name a
willingness to contemplate governmentally enforced abortions and a
denial of food to surviving populations of nations which have not
enacted population-control policies. For all these reasons it [is
possible to counterpoise over against the need for survival a \"tyranny
of survival.\" There seems to be no imaginable evil which some group is
not willing to inflict on another for sake of survival, no rights,
liberties or dignities which it is not ready to suppress]{.underline}.
It is easy, of course, to recognize the danger when survival is falsely
and manipulatively invoked. Dictators never talk about their
aggressions, but only about the need to defend the fatherland to save it
from destruction at the hands of its enemies. But my point goes deeper
than that. It is directed even at a legitimate concern for survival,
when that concern is allowed to reach an intensity which would ignore,
suppress or destroy other fundamental human rights and values. The
[potential tyranny survival as value is that it is capable, if not
treated sanely, of wiping out all other values.]{.underline} Survival
can become an obsession and a disease, provoking a destructive
single-mindedness that will stop at nothing. We come here to the
fundamental moral dilemma. If, both biologically and psychologically,
the need for survival is basic to man, and if survival is the
precondition for any and all human achievements, and if no other rights
make much sense without the premise of a right to life---then how will
it be possible to honor and act upon the need for survival without, in
the process, destroying everything in human beings which makes them
worthy of survival. To put it more strongly, if the price of survival is
human degradation, then there is no moral reason why an effort should be
made to ensure that survival. It would be the Pyrrhic victory to end all
Pyrrhic victories. Yet it would be the defeat of all defeats if, because
human beings could not properly manage their need to survive, they
succeeded in not doing so.

## Utilitarianism disregards respect for the individual and perpetuates societal inequality by evaluating utility as a whole {#utilitarianism-disregards-respect-for-the-individual-and-perpetuates-societal-inequality-by-evaluating-utility-as-a-whole .Tags}

Freeman 94 -- Avalon Professor in the Humanities at the University of
Pennsylvania, Ph.D. Harvard University, J.D. University of North

[The inclusion of all sentient beings in the calculation of interests
severely undermines the force of any claim that utilitarianism is an
\"egalitarian\" doctrine, based in some notion of equal concern and
respect for persons]{.underline}. But let us assume Kymlicka can restore
his thesis by insisting that it concerns, not utilitarianism as a
general moral doctrine, but as a more limited thesis about political
morality. (Here I pass over the fact that none of the utilitarians he
relies on to support his egalitarian interpretation construe the
doctrine as purely political. The drift of modern utilitarian theory is
just the other way: [utilitarianism is not seen as a political doctrine,
to be appealed to by legislators and citizens, but a nonpublic criterion
of right that is indirectly applied]{.underline} \[by whom is a separate
issue\] [to assess the nonutilitarian public political conception of
justice]{.underline}.) Still, let us assume it is as a doctrine of
political morality that utilitarianism treats persons, and only persons,
as equals. [Even in this form it cannot be that maximizing utility is
\"not a goal\" but a \"by-product,\" \"entirely derived from the prior
requirement to treat people with equal consideration\"]{.underline}
(CPP, p. 31) Kymlicka says, \"If utilitarianism is best seen as an
egalitarian doctrine, then there is no independent commitment to the
idea of maximizing welfare\" (CPP, p. 35, emphases added). But how can
this be? (i) What is there about the formal principle of equal
consideration (or for that matter occupying a universal point of view)
which would imply that we maximize the aggregate of individuals\'
welfare? Why not assume, for example, that equal consideration requires
maximizing the division of welfare (strict equality, or however equal
division is to be construed); or, at least maximize the multiple (which
would result in more equitable distributions than the aggregate)? Or,
why not suppose equal consideration requires equal proportionate
satisfaction of each person\'s interests (by for example, determining
our resources and then satisfying some set percentage of each person\'s
desires) . Or finally we might rely on some Paretian principle: equal
consideration means adopting measures making no one worse off. For
reasons I shall soon discuss, each of these rules is a better
explication of equal consideration of each person\'s interests than is
[the utilitarian aggregative method,]{.underline} which in effect
[collapses distinctions among persons]{.underline}. (2) Moreover, rather
than construing individuals\' \"interests\" as their actual (or
rational) desires, and then putting them all on a par and measuring
according to intensity, why not construe their interests lexically, in
terms of a hierarchy of wants, where certain interests are, to use
Scanlon\'s terms, more \"urgent\" than others, insofar as they are more
basic needs? Equal consideration would then rule out satisfying less
urgent interests of the majority of people until all means have been
taken to satisfy everyone\'s more basic needs. (3) Finally, what is
there about equal consideration, by itself, that requires maximizing
anything? Why does it not require, as in David Gauthier\'s view,
optimizing constraints on individual utility maximization? Or why does
it not require sharing a distribution? The point is just that, [to say
we ought to give equal consideration to everyone\'s interests does not,
by itself, imply much of anything about how we ought to proceed or what
we ought to do. It is a purely formal principle]{.underline}, which
requires certain added, independent assumptions, to yield any
substantive conclusions. That (i) [utilitarian procedures maximize is
not a \"by-product\" of equal consideration]{.underline}. It stems from
a particular conception of rationality that is explicitly incorporated
into the procedure. That (2) [individuals\' interests are construed in
terms of their (rational) desires or preferences, all of which are put
on a par, stems from a conception of individual welfare or the human
good: a person\'s good is defined subjectively]{.underline}, as what he
wants or would want after due reflection. Finally (3), aggregation stems
from the fact that, [on the classical view, a single individual takes up
everyone\'s desires as if they were his own, sympathetically identifies
with them, and chooses to maximize his \"individual\"
utility]{.underline}. Hare, for one, explicitly makes this move. Just as
Rawls says of the classical view, Hare \"extend\[s\] to society the
principle of choice for one man, and then, to make this extension work,
conflat\[es\] all persons into one through the imaginative acts of the
impartial sympathetic spectator\" (TJ, p. 27). If these are independent
premises incorporated into the justification of utilitarianism and its
decision procedure, then [maximizing aggregate utility cannot be a
\"by-product\" of a procedure that gives equal consideration to
everyone\'s interests. Instead, it defines what that procedure is. If
anything is a by-product here, it is the appeal to equal
consideration]{.underline}. Utilitarians appeal to impartiality in order
to extend a method of individual practical rationality so that it may be
applied to society as a whole (cf. TJ, pp. 26-27). Impartiality,
combined with sympathetic identification, allows a hypothetical observer
to experience the desires of others as if they were his own, and compare
alternative courses of action according to their conduciveness to a
single maximand, made possible by equal consideration and sympathy. [The
significant fact is that]{.underline}, in this procedure, [appeals to
equal consideration have nothing to do with impartiality between
persons. What is really being given equal consideration are desires or
experiences of the same magnitude. That these are the desires or
experiences of separate persons]{.underline} (or, for that matter, of
some other sentient being) [is simply an incidental fact that has no
substantive effect on utilitarian calculations]{.underline}. This
becomes apparent from the fact that we can more accurately describe the
utilitarian principle in terms of giving, not equal consideration to
each person\'s interests, but instead equal consideration to equally
intense interests, no matter where they occur. Nothing is lost in this
redescription, and a great deal of clarity is gained. It is in this
sense that [persons enter into utilitarian calculations only
incidentally. Any mention of them can be dropped without loss of the
crucial information one needs to learn how to apply utilitarian
procedures. This indicates what is wrong with the common claim that
utilitarians emphasize procedural equality and fairness among persons,
not substantive equality and fairness in results]{.underline}. On the
contrary, utilitarianism, rightly construed, emphasizes neither
procedural nor substantive equality among persons. Desires and
experiences, not persons, are the proper objects of equal concern in
utilitarian procedures. Having in effect read persons out of the picture
at the procedural end, before decisions on distributions even get
underway, [it is little wonder that utilitarianism can result in such
substantive inequalities]{.underline}. What follows is that [utilitarian
appeals to democracy and the democratic value of equality are
misleading]{.underline}**.** In no sense do utilitarians seek to give
persons equal concern and respect.

## Although utilitarianism claims to result in equality, its nature to only regard people as one entity rather than a group of individuals inherently contradicts the principle of equality {#although-utilitarianism-claims-to-result-in-equality-its-nature-to-only-regard-people-as-one-entity-rather-than-a-group-of-individuals-inherently-contradicts-the-principle-of-equality .Tags}

313-349, http://www.jstor.org/stable/2265463)

[To sum up, though utilitarianism incorporates equality as a property of
the justification of the principle of utility]{.underline}, and of the
decision process through which that principle gets applied, [it does not
leave any place for equality in the content of that
principle]{.underline}. On its face, this standard of right conduct
directs that we maximize an aggregate. [As a result neither equality or
any other distributive value is assigned independent
significance]{.underline} in resulting distributions of goods. Kymlicka
claims that, because Rawls sees utilitarianism as teleological, he
misdescribes the debate over distribution by ignoring that utilitarians
allow for equality of distribution too. But [the distribution debate
Rawls is concerned with is a]{.underline} (level 2) [debate over how
what is deemed good (welfare, rights, resources, etc.) within a moral
theory is to be divided among individua]{.underline}ls. It is not a
(level 3) debate over the distribution of consideration in a procedure
which decides the distribution of these goods. Nor is it a (level 1)
debate over the principles of practical reasoning that are invoked to
justify the fundamental standard of distribution.

## Owning oneself is a moral imperative -- utilitarianism imposes interpersonal obligations to society, which destroys morality {#owning-oneself-is-a-moral-imperative-utilitarianism-imposes-interpersonal-obligations-to-society-which-destroys-morality .Tags}

Freeman 94 -- Avalon Professor in the Humanities at the University of

Right," Philosophy and Public Affairs, Vol. 23, No. 4, Autumn, pp.
313-349, http://www.jstor.org/stable/2265463)

Kymlicka distinguishes two interpretations of utilitarianism:
teleological and egalitarian. [According to Rawls\'s teleological
interpretation, the \"fundamental goal\"]{.underline} (LCC, p. 33) [of
utilitarianism is not persons, but the goodness of states of
affairs]{.underline}. Duty is defined by what best brings about these
states of affairs. \" \[M\] aximizing the good is primary, and we count
individuals equally only because that maximizes value. [Our primary duty
isn\'t to treat people as equals, but to bring about valuable states of
affairs\"]{.underline} (LCC, p. 27). [It is difficult to
see,]{.underline} Kymlicka says, [how this reading of utilitarianism can
be viewed as a moral theory. Morality, in our everyday view at least, is
a matter of interpersonal obligations-the obligations we owe to each
other. But to whom do we owe the duty of maximizing utility? Surely not
to the impersonal ideal spectator]{.underline} . . . [for he doesn\'t
exist]{.underline}. Nor to the maximally valuable state of affairs
itself, for states of affairs don\'t have moral claims.\" (LCC, p.
28-29) Kymlicka says, \"This form of utilitarianism does not merit
serious consideration as a political morality\" (LCC, p. 29). Suppose we
see utilitarianism differently, as a theory whose \"fundamental
principle\" is \"to treat people as equals\" (LCC, p. 29). On this
egalitarian reading, utilitarianism is a procedure for aggregating
individual interests and desires, a procedure for making social choices,
specifying which trade-offs are acceptable. It\'s a moral theory which
purports to treat people as equals, with equal concern and respect. It
does so by counting everyone for one, and no one for more than one.

At first glance, this structure may seem vulnerable to two different
objections. First, [any proposal to compare or balance competing
interests can be criticized as leading ineluctably back to some form of
utilitarianism]{.underline} (perhaps a \"utilitarianism of rights\").72
If the adverse consequences of a right must be weighed in some manner
against the benefits of the right, how can any barriers against loss of
autonomy survive? [There will always be some concatenation of
consequences that those bent on overcoming the right will assert
outweighs the claim of the individual]{.underline}. Does not this kind
of relativism ultimately degenerate into some reconstituted version of
utilitarianism, effectively leveling the moral landscape into continual
balancing exercises?

In defining those rights, it seems natural to begin by stating clearly
which aspects of an [autonomous individual require protection
from]{.underline} consideration of [utility maximization. The rights in
the system constrain the behavior of others that might harm these
aspects of the individua]{.underline}l. One might begin with the idea of
preservation. [Securing the moral significance of the individual should
at least center on preserving that individual\'s life.]{.underline}
Preservation ought then to be extended to include the broader concept of
physical or bodily integrity, because many physical assaults short of
death can so damage or injure an individual as to reduce dramatically
the quality of that individual\'s life. [Rights should at least prevent
substantial invasions of bodily integrity.]{.underline}

This objection can, as Samuel Scheffler has pointed out, be integrated
with objection . Remember that Rawls claimed that [utilitarianism fails
to \'\'take seriously the distinction between persons.\" One person can
be forced by utilitarianism to give up far too much]{.underline},
including the life plan that he or she has formulated for himself or
herself. Rational agents who are fully aware of what they would be
putting on the line if they were to agree to a utilitarian society would
never adopt utilitarianism. They would perceive that [such a society
could require them to sacrifice their individual projects]{.underline},
their freedom, and even their lives for the sake of the aggregate or
total satisfaction of the group. To agree to such a collective approach
would be to degrade their autonomy, and this is a matter of integrity.
As Scheffler observes regarding the integration of (H) and (J), \"the
two objections focus on two different ways of making the same supposed
mistake: two different ways of failing to take sufficient account of the
separateness and nature of persons.\"

[Equity has provided a limited answer to the question of acceptable
risk.]{.underline} The traditional doctrine of injunctions against
tortious behavior holds [that courts may enjoin behavior that is
virtually certain to harm an identifiable individual in the near
future]{.underline}.\'2 This body of law, however, focuses more on
avoidance of harm to specific persons than on regulation of risk.\'3 It
is thus inapposite to the questions of modern technological risk,
[risk]{.underline} that [is quite unlikely to injure any identifiable
individual in the short-term, but that carries severe consequences that
are certain to occur to someone in the medium to distant
future]{.underline}. Consider the paradigm of the Acme Chemical Company:
Acme Chemical Company is discovered to be storing chemical wastes on its
land in such a way that seepage containing traces of those wastes are
entering an underground water system that serves as the sole drinking
water supply for a town several miles away. One of the chemicals has
been classified as a carcinogen in laboratory experiments on mice.
Although extrapolating from these results to predictions of human
carcinogencity is somewhat controversial, federal agencies routinely do
so. Under one of a number of plausible sets of assumptions, a
concentration of ten parts per billion (ppb) in drinking water is
estimated to increase a human\'s chance of contracting cancer by one in
one hundred thousand if the human is assumed to consume a normal intake
over the course of twenty years. Analyses show that the current
concentration in the underground aquifer near Acme\'s plant is ten ppb.
This case exhibits the typical features of risky actions associated with
modern technology. [The probability of risk to any individual is
relatively small while its severity is substantial, perhaps fatal. Risk
is being imposed on individuals who have not consented to it in any
meaningful sense]{.underline}. Finally, risk is unintentional in the
sense that imposing risk on others is not an objective of Acme\'s
plan.\'4 We may assume its executives in fact would be tremendously
relieved if they could avoid the risk.

## Government coercion threatens individual freedom and renders morality meaningless {#government-coercion-threatens-individual-freedom-and-renders-morality-meaningless .Tags}

Gauthier 2K (Candace, PhD Associate Professor in the Department of
Philosophy and Religion at the University of North Carolina, Kennedy
Institute of Ethics Journal)

Instances of coercion and constraint also may exempt agents from
judgments of moral responsibility. [Coercion and constraint, as used
here, should be understood as the imposition of some external force that
compels or precludes a particular choice or a particular action
itself]{.underline}. Certainly there are degrees of coercion and
constraint, and consideration of the form and degree of external force
imposed can affect the extent to which one considers an action to have
been less than voluntary. [The greater the threat imposed by some
external force, the more it eliminates or controls choice]{.underline}.
Some external threats are so great as to totally bypass choice, leading
directly to action, while others may control choice to the extent that a
particular action is virtually ensured. [Finally, some threats reduce
the voluntariness of an action by making any other choice extremely
difficult for an individual to make in the face of the relevant
threat]{.underline}. Thus, [the greater the coercion or constraint, the
less likely we will be to consider the action voluntary and the less
moral responsibility we will assign to the agent]{.underline}. \[End
Page 343\] When the autonomy of those who have the capacity for rational
agency is respected, they are permitted to make choices and act
according to their beliefs and values, to the extent that their actions
pose no risk of harm to individuals or to the community. [In the absence
of overwhelming coercive factors]{.underline} or controlling
constraints, [we hold these autonomous individuals morally responsible
for their choices and actions]{.underline}. This does not mean that
those beliefs and values are themselves totally chosen. Certainly, moral
responsibility can be and is assigned with the understanding that the
person who has voluntarily chosen and acted is the product of a family,
a community, and all of the other societal influences that make
individuals who they are. The assignment of moral responsibility is part
of an important method of social control through which the community
furthers common ends and interests (Smiley 1992, pp. 238-54). Although
moral responsibility in the first sense discussed here is a neutral
judgment, recognizing both causality and moral agency, it is the basis
for praise and blame, reward and punishment. These are essential ways in
which communities may effect personal change in their members toward
behavior that is more in concert with communal values and ends. For
example, if judgments of praise and blame are internalized, they create
the \"social emotions\" of guilt, shame, and pride that contribute to
the development of conscience (Gaylin and Jennings 1996, pp. 137-49). As
part of the social control provided by praise and blame, the assignment
of moral responsibility operates within a pluralistic democratic society
by permitting areas of life in which the individual may choose and act,
free of coercion and constraint, but with the understanding that these
choices and actions are subject to judgment and criticism by others in
the community. However, [communitarians sometimes appear to go even
farther, to seek even more social control based on a shared vision of
the good life that is determined either by the majority or by the
elites. This tendency]{.underline} is an \"excess\" of the communitarian
movement that [may lead to a \"tyranny of the majority.\" Pushing the
laudable communitarian concern with shared values and the common good to
this extreme would destroy the individual]{.underline}, create persons
\"constituted by the group\'s shared aims,\" and \"leave little or no
room for criticism of the group will\" (Kuczewski 1997, pp. 106-8).
Moreover, [without individuals who are free to make choices]{.underline}
based on their traditions, histories, and a variety of communal
influences as well as their own consideration of all of these factors,
[moral responsibility has no meaning. Once the force of law is behind
shared values and how they are to be honored in individual lives and
decisions, we would have a level of control through legal coercion that
would leave little room for moral responsibility]{.underline} based on
the voluntarily chosen actions of moral agents. Thus, the imposition of
communal values, in all areas of life, would jeopardize the social
practice of assigning moral responsibility for individual action.

[A classic objection to both act and rule utilitarianism has to do with
inequity]{.underline}, and is related to the kind of objection raised by
Rawls, which I will consider shortly. Suppose we have two fathers-Andy
and Bob. Suppose further that they are alike in all relevant respects,
both have three children, make the same salary, have the same living
expenses, put aside the same amount in savings, and have left over each
week fifteen dollars. Suppose that every week Andy and Bob ask
themselves what they are going to do with this extra money, and Andy
decides anew each week (AU) to divide it equally among his three
children, or he makes a decision to always follow the rule (RU) that
each child should receive an equal percentage of the total allowance
money. Suppose further that each of his children receive five degrees of
pleasure from this and no pain. Suppose on the other hand, that Bob, who
strongly favors his oldest son, Bobby, decides anew each week (AU) to
give all of the allowance money to Bobby, and nothing to the other two,
and that he instructs Bobby not to tell the others, or he makes a
decision to follow the rule (RU) to always give the total sum to Bobby.
Suppose also that Bobby gets IS units of pleasure from his allowance and
that his unsuspecting siblings feel no pain. The end result of the
actions of both fathers is the same-IS units of pleasure. Most, if not
all, of us would agree that although Andy\'s conduct is exemplary,
Bob\'s is culpable. Nevertheless, according to both AU and RU the
fathers in question are morally *equal.* Neither father is more or less
exemplary or culpable than the other. I will refer to the objection
implicit in this kind of example as (H) and state it as: \' (H) [Both
act and rule utilitarianism violate the principle of just distribution.
What Rawls does is to elaborate objection]{.underline} (H).
[Utilitarianism, according to Rawls, fails to appreciate the importance
of distributive justice, and that by doing so it makes a mockery of the
concept of \"justice.\"]{.underline} As I pointed out when I discussed
Russell\'s views regarding partial goods, [satisfying the interests of a
majority of a given population while at the same time thwarting the
interests of the minority segment of that same population (as occurs in
societies that allow slavery) can maximize the general good, and do so
even though the minority group may have to suffer great
cruelties.]{.underline} Rawls argues that the utilitarian commitment to
maximize the good in the world is due to its failure to \'\'take
seriously the distinction between persons.\"· [One person can be forced
to give up far too much to insure the maximization of the
good]{.underline}, or the total aggregate satisfaction, as was the case
for those young Aztec women chosen by their society each year to be
sacrificed to the Gods for the welfare of the group.

## Utilitarianism destroys value to life by forcing the individual to take risks on a cost-benefit basis in an effort to increase overall utility of an entity, while demoralizing the individual's own system of values {#utilitarianism-destroys-value-to-life-by-forcing-the-individual-to-take-risks-on-a-cost-benefit-basis-in-an-effort-to-increase-overall-utility-of-an-entity-while-demoralizing-the-individuals-own-system-of-values .Tags}

[From the individual\'s point of view, the balancing of costs and
benefits that utilitarianism endorses renders the status of any
individual risk bearer profoundly insecure. A risk bearer cannot
determine from the kind of risk being imposed on him whether it is
impermissible or not.]{.underline} The identical risk may be justified
if necessary to avoid a calamity and unjustified if the product of an
act of profitless carelessness, but the [nature and extent of the
underlying benefits of the risky action are fre quently unknown to the
risk bearer so that he cannot know whether or not he is being wronged.
Furthermore,]{.underline} even when the gain that lies behind the risk
is well-known, [the status of a risk bearer is insecure because
individuals can justifiably be inflicted with ever greater levels of
risk in conjunction with increasing gains]{.underline}. Certainly,
individual risk bearers may be entitled to more protection if the risky
action exposes many others to the same risk, since the likelihood that
technological risks will cause greater harm increases as more and more
people experience that risk. This makes the risky action less likely to
be justifiable. Once again, however, [that insight seems scant comfort
to an individual, for it reinforces the realization that, standing
alone, he does not count for much]{.underline}. A strategy of weighing
gains against risks thus renders the status of any specific risk victim
substantially contingent upon the claims of others, both those who may
share his victim status and those who stand to gain from the risky
activity. The anxiety to preserve some fundamental place for the
individual that cannot be overrun by larger social considerations
underlies what H.L.A. Hart has aptly termed the \"distinctively modern
criticism of utilitarianism,\"58 the criticism that, [despite its famous
slogan, \"everyone \[is\] to count for one,\"59 utilitarianism
ultimately denies each individual a primary place in its system of
values]{.underline}. Various versions of utilitarian ism evaluate
actions by the consequences of those actions to maximize happiness, the
net of pleasure over pain, or the satisfaction of desires.60 Whatever
the specific formulation, the [goal of maximizing some mea sure of
utility obscures and diminishes the status of each
individual]{.underline}. It reduces the individual to a conduit, a
reference point that registers the appropriate \"utiles,\" but does not
count for anything independent of his monitoring function.61 [It also
produces moral requirements that can trample an individual,]{.underline}
if necessary, [to maximize utility, since once the net effects of a
proposal on the maximand have been taken into account, the individual is
expendable]{.underline}. Counting pleasure and pain equally across
individuals is a laudable proposal, but counting only plea sure and pain
permits the grossest inequities among individuals and the trampling of
the few in furtherance of the utility of the many. [In sum,
utilitarianism makes the status of any individual radically
contingent]{.underline}. The individual\'s status will be preserved only
so long as that status con tributes to increasing total utility.
Otherwise, the individual can be discarded.

## The only way to preserve individualism is to allow all persons to have the right to own themselves regardless of any negative consequentialist impacts {#the-only-way-to-preserve-individualism-is-to-allow-all-persons-to-have-the-right-to-own-themselves-regardless-of-any-negative-consequentialist-impacts .Tags}

2\. Liberal Theories in the \"Rights\" Tradition. [A second group of
theories avoids the modern criticism of utilitarianism by making the
individual central.]{.underline} Contemporary theorists as diverse as
John Rawls, Robert Nozick, Richard Epstein, Charles Fried, and Ronald
Dworkin continue a tradition variously described as the Kantian, natural
rights, or [\"rights\" tradition]{.underline}.62 They all [define the
requirements of justice in terms of recognizing and preserving the
essential characteristics of individuals as free and autonomous moral
agents.63 In this approach, the individual is defined prior to
articulating the terms under which that individual can be acted upon or
interacted with, and those terms are consequently specified so as to
protect and preserve what is essential to the individual]{.underline}.
In this context, [rights]{.underline} have been called \"trumps\" since
they [constrain what society can do to the individual.64 These theories
all aspire to make the individual more secure than he is under
utilitarianism.]{.underline} In the rights tradition, the crucial
criteria for assessing risks derive from the impact of those risks on
risk victims, and the criteria are defined independently of the benefits
flowing from risk creation. To be plausible, such a program cannot
totally prohibit risk creation, but the ostensible advantage of this
program over utilitarianism is that risk creation is circumscribed by
criteria exclusively derived from considerations of the integrity of the
individual, not from any balancing or weighing process.65 The root idea
is that nonconsensual risks are violations of \"individual entitlements
to personal security and autonomy.\"66 This idea seems highly congruent
with the ideology of environmentalism expressed in our national
legislation regulating technological risk. Indeed, two scholars have
recently suggested a modern rendering of Kant\'s categorical imperative:
\"[All rational persons have a right not to be used without their
consent even for the benefit of others]{.underline}.\"67 If imposing
risk amounts to using another, this tradition seems to be the place to
look [to secure the status of the individual]{.underline}.

## Utilitarianism allows larger powers like the government to control the individual as long a greater utility is achieved. It is immoral to violate the sanctity of human life. {#utilitarianism-allows-larger-powers-like-the-government-to-control-the-individual-as-long-a-greater-utility-is-achieved.-it-is-immoral-to-violate-the-sanctity-of-human-life. .Tags}

[In modern society, the overwhelming power of centralized authority,
whether of the state or of other large institutions, looms over every
individual. Utilitarianism is a philosophy that legitimizes that power
and countenances the anxiety that comes with it so long as total utility
is increased]{.underline}. In the process of that legitimization,
[utilitarianism fails to accommodate society\'s deeply held moral ideals
concerning the special sanctity of human life.]{.underline} \"\[W\]e
prefer to think of \[lives\] as beyond price. . . . To the extent that
our lives and institutions depend on the notion that life is beyond
price . . . a refusal to save lives is horribly costly.\"68
[Cost-benefit analysis flaunts the legitimacy of placing a price on
life]{.underline}. The depth of hostile reactions to the utilitarian
tradition that has been displayed in the environmental era cannot fully
be comprehended until the antipathy to this aspect of that tradition is
understood.

## Utilitarianism suppresses individual choice-making -- freedom gives value to life {#utilitarianism-suppresses-individual-choice-making-freedom-gives-value-to-life .Tags}

Schroeder 86 -- Professor of Law at Duke (Christopher H., "Rights
Against Risks," April, Columbia Law Review, pp. 495-562,
http://www.jstor.org/pss/1122636)

Under this concept of rules, [rules may intervene to
preclude]{.underline} or limit [the consideration of
consequences]{.underline}, and thus such consideration will not
inevitably collapse all issues of moral choice into a case-by-case
cost-benefit analysis. Any theory intent on maintaining individual
integrity and autonomy will likely generate some rules that protect
individuals from the radical contingency associated with utilitarianism.
Autonomy implies some [moral space within which an individual can make
choices even if those choices do not maximize utility.]{.underline}
\"Rights\" in theories emphasizing individual autonomy function as rules
providing individuals with moral space. They eliminate from
consideration of the justness of an action some arguments and factual
aspects that might otherwise bear on that judgment. Notice that this
idea of rights is consistent with taking consequences into account.
Consequences can be taken into account at the rule formulation stage. If
a rule then makes certain consequences irrelevant to its subsequent
application, these \"rights regardless of consequences\" ignore
consequences only because the consequences of granting those rights had
been taken into account when the rights were formulated[. Within a
nonutilitarian theory, then, there is a valid distinction between
weighing the consequences of a risky action and weighing the
consequences of a rule regulating risky actions.]{.underline} One point
this section makes is that this distinction cannot plausibly result in a
rule that risks should be regulated regardless of consequences, but that
fact alone does not demonstrate that either the structure of the
arguments supporting this conclusion or the norms of behavior derived
from them are simply reformulations of utilitarianism.76 Even if the
proposal to take consequences into account does not reproduce a form of
utilitarianism, a second objection may be voiced. It might be thought
that the proposal embodies the same fundamental mistake that has
resulted in criticism of utilitarianism. Once again an individual\'s
security will become contingent upon the consequential value to others
of actions affecting that individual\'s vital interests. Although the
problem of contingency is real, the criticism of utilitarianism outlined
above cannot be leveled against the manner in which contingency has been
reintroduced. This is because, notwithstanding the current fashion of
equating \"consequentialism\" with \"utilitarianism,\"77 utilitarianism
is a unique subset of consequentialism, and arguments aimed at it cannot
simply be appropriated to indict all theories that consider consequences
to be relevant. [Utilitarianism\'s special use of consequences isolates
a single consequential aspect of actions contribution to the
maximand-and assesses the propriety of action exclusively by that
measure. It is this feature of utilitarianism, not the simple ingredient
of considering consequences, that makes it vulnerable to the charge of
ignoring individuals.78 It is perfectly feasible to construct moral
theories that employ consequences in their evaluation of the rightness
of actions without thereby endorsing utilitarian
reductionism]{.underline}.79 In specific cases, one individual might be
given his \"rights\" by a second individual only at the second
individual\'s great discomfort, inconvenience, and perhaps even risk of
life.

## Governments have a responsibility to maintain human rights and individualism -- utilitarianism undermines human rights  {#governments-have-a-responsibility-to-maintain-human-rights-and-individualism-utilitarianism-undermines-human-rights .Tags}

Kateb 92 -- Professor of Politics at Princeton University (George, "The
Inner Ocean: Individualism and Democratic Culture," p. 5)

[To tie dignity to rights is therefore to say that governments have the
absolute duty to treat people]{.underline} (by actions and abstentions)
[in certain ways, and]{.underline} in certain ways only. The state's
characteristic domination and insolence are to be curbed for the sake of
rights. Public and formal respect for rights registers and strengthens
awareness of three constitutive facts of being human[: every person is a
creature capable of feeling pain, and is a free agent capable of having
a free being, of living a life that is one's own and not somebody else's
idea of how a life should be lived, and is a moral agent capable of
acknowledging that what one claims for oneself]{.underline} as a right
[one can claim only]{.underline} as an [equal to everyone
else]{.underline} (and relatedly that what one wants done to oneself one
should do to others). Respect for rights recognizes these capacities and
thus honors human dignity. I know that adequate recognition of these
human capabilities does not entail respect for rights as the sole and
necessary conclusion. This respect is not a matter of logical inference.
Rather, given initial sentiments -- say, fellow feeling or special
sensitivity to pain or dislike of power -- recognition can lead to or
add up to a theoretical affirmation of rights. The most important
sentiment by far is for the idea that [every individual is equally a
world, an infinity, a being who is irreplaceable]{.underline}. At the
same time, [there are other theories that seem to affirm human dignity
yet give rights only a lesser or probationary or instrumental role.
Examples are utilitarianism]{.underline}, recent communitarianism,
recent republicanism, and radical egalitarianism. The first and last I
will return to shortly; my response to the others appears her and there
in this volume. [All I wish to say now is that unless rights come first,
they are not rights]{.underline}. They will tend to be sacrificed to
some purpose deemed higher than the equal dignity of every individual.
The group or the majority or the good or the sacred or the vague future
will be preferred. The beneficiaries will be victimized along with the
victims because no one is being treated as a person who is irreplaceable
and beyond value. To make rights anything but primary, even though in
the name of human dignity, is to injure human dignity.

## Theories of right preserve value to life -- government politics with the intention of increasing overall utility through environmentalism destroy morality and deceives the individual {#theories-of-right-preserve-value-to-life-government-politics-with-the-intention-of-increasing-overall-utility-through-environmentalism-destroy-morality-and-deceives-the-individual .Tags}

[Theories in the rights tradition resonate with ideals regarding life
and its sanctity. These theories]{.underline}, however, can [provide a
reliable guide to risk regulation only if they can fit their analysis of
rights against risk with other legitimate values to
comprise]{.underline} a coherent theory of government. It is the thesis
of this Article that the notion of a right against risk that trumps all
considerations of countervailing values cannot be so validated by any
theory in the rights tradition. Despite the appealing absolutist
language of nonutilitarian theories, [the countervailing benefits of
risky actions persistently return and demand consideration. This is so
at the level of practical politics, where the years after passage of our
major environmental statutes have witnessed creative maneuvers by
courts, agencies, and Congress to avoid actually implementing absolute
rights against risk whenever the substantial costs of achieving
extremely low levels of risk become undeniable]{.underline}.69 It is
also true at the level of theory. Once one looks beyond the glitter of
catchphrases to examine their accounts, [seemingly absolutist
nonutilitarian]{.underline} theories [do not support absolute rights
against risk]{.underline}. Any defensible theory of risk regulation must
acknowledge the relevance of countervailing interests and values. Given
the modern attack on utilitarianism,70 a proposed theory must also avoid
comparing benefits and risks in a way that collapses the theory into
utilitarianism. Unfortunately, \"[absolutist]{.underline}\" rhetoric
applied to risk regulation [is so obsessed with avoiding the error of
utilitarianism that it commits an opposite mistake by obscuring the
interests of risk creators. Environmentalists]{.underline}, as well as
others concerned about risk regulation, [ought to divorce themselves
from much of the popular language of rights as absolutes because the
terminology evokes a misleading expectation]{.underline} of a
theoretical justification for risk rules that cannot in fact be
supplied. An attempted justification fails if it ignores the legitimate
interests of risk creators and others who benefit from the creation of
risk. Still, a [nonabsolutist understanding of risk must preserve the
essential moral insight of the rights tradition that individuals matter
as autonomous moral agents worthy of respect]{.underline}. This Article
moves in the direction of such an understanding by examining the nature
of the conflict between the interests of risk creator and risk bearer,
and how modern rights theories deal with that conflict. lth Care

## Utilitarianism inevitable even in deontological frameworks {#utilitarianism-inevitable-even-in-deontological-frameworks .Tags}

Green, 02 -- Assistant Professor Department of Psychology Harvard
University (Joshua, November 2002 \"The Terrible, Horrible, No Good,
Very Bad Truth About Morality And What To Do About It\", 314)

Some people who talk of balancing rights may think there is an algorithm
for deciding which rights take priority over which. If that's what we
mean by 302 "balancing rights," then we are wise to shun this sort of
talk[. Attempting to solve moral problems using a complex deontological
algorithm is dogmatism at its most esoteric, but dogmatism all the same.
However, it's likely that when some people talk about "balancing
competing rights and obligations" they are already thinking like
consequentialists in spite of their use of deontological
language.]{.underline} Once again, what deontological language does best
is express the thoughts of people struck by strong, emotional moral
intuitions: "It doesn't matter that you can save five people by pushing
him to his death. To do this would be a violation of his rights!"19
[That is why angry protesters say things like, "Animals Have Rights,
Too!" rather than, "Animal Testing: The Harms Outweigh the Benefits!"
Once again, rights talk captures the apparent clarity of the issue and
absoluteness of the answer.]{.underline} But sometimes rights talk
persists long after the sense of clarity and absoluteness has faded. One
thinks, for example, of the thousands of children whose lives are saved
by drugs that were tested on animals and the "rights" of those children.
[One finds oneself balancing the "rights" on both sides by asking how
many rabbit lives one is willing to sacrifice in order to save one human
life, and so on, and at the end of the day one's underlying thought is
as thoroughly consequentialist as can be, despite the deontological
gloss.]{.underline} And what's wrong with that? Nothing, except for the
fact that the [deontological gloss adds nothing and furthers the myth
that there really are "rights," etc. Best to drop it. When deontological
talk gets sophisticated, the thought it represents is either dogmatic in
an esoteric sort of way or covertly consequentialist.]{.underline}

My thesis that all three layers/forms of political association are
important in a well-ordered liberal democracy also implies the
untenability of Rawls\'s argument that agreement regarding norms of
social justice is a possible and sufficient way to overcome the
deficiencies of the modus vivendi approach. In the first place, as I
have argued in more detail elsewhere, [the fundamental unfairness of
life and the presence of gratuitous elements in the moral universe make
it impossible to settle rationally upon a single set of distributive
principles as demonstrably fair]{.underline} (See also, Spragens 1993).
Simply put, the problem is that the contingencies of the world
ineluctably allocate assets and sufferings quite unfairly. [We can cope
with and try to compensate for these \"natural injustices,\" but only at
the price of introducing other elements of unfairness or compromising
other moral values**.**]{.underline} The other major problem in this
context is that [real world human beings are not deontologists: their
moral intuitions about distributive justice are permeated and influenced
by their moral intuitions about the\' good]{.underline}. The empirical
consequence of these two difficulties is the falsification of Rawls\'s
hermeneutic claims about an overlapping consensus. [Rational people of
good will with a liberal democratic persuasion will be able to agree
that some possible distributive criteria are morally unacceptable. But,
as both experience and the literature attest, hopes for a convergence of
opinion on definitive principles of distributive justice are
chimerical.]{.underline}

not compelling. Gitlin seems to assume that failures of deterrence or
inevitable accidents must lead to all-out nuclear war, but that is far
from self-evident.]{.underline} Indeed, a case can be made that an
accident or partial failure of deterrence may be the prelude to
substantial changes that reduce risks or reliance on nuclear deterrence
in the long term. But even if he were right about catastrophe, it is odd
for Gitlin to discount \"microscopic probability\" by asking, \"[Do we
feel secure playing Russian roulette if the revolver has a hundred
chambers?\" Perhaps not, but if we had to play, I doubt that we really
would not care if a revolver had one hundred chambers rather than
six!]{.underline} And if he readmits probabilistic reasoning, then [it
can also be applied to the question of relative risks between unilateral
disarmament (\"refusing to play\") and trying to increase the number of

exists.]{.underline}

rules.]{.underline} In other words, [the tendency for self-deception in

Utilitarianism[, it has evolved no processes for hedging around its
rules.]{.underline} One therefore understands Harsanyi (1985, p. 49)
when he describes utilitarian rules as \'conditional imperatives\', that
is, people should fol? low them because in this way they will maximize
expected social utility. Of course, he expects all rational people to
have an interest in promot? ing the common good and therefore to be
utilitarians. (By contrast, many people regard moral rules as
unconditionally binding or \'categori cal imperatives\').

that rights assign to certain kinds of human inviolability, which makes
this consequence morally intelligible?' (p.89, our emphasis -- note the
presumption inherent in the question). **T**he answer 'focuses on the
status conferred on all human beings by the design of a morality which

inviolable (which is not, of course, to say that one will not be
violated, but that one may not be violated -- even to minimize the total
number of such violations). A system of morality that includes
inviolability encapsulates a good that its rivals cannot capture**.**
For, **'**not only is it an evil for a person to be harmed in certain
ways, but for it to be permissible to harm the person in those ways is
an additional and independent evil' (p.91). So there is a sense in which

## Deontology comes first, the means must justify themselves -- utilitarianism justifies the Holocaust.  {#deontology-comes-first-the-means-must-justify-themselves-utilitarianism-justifies-the-holocaust. .Tags}

Ministries International, , Probe Ministries "Utilitarianism:

The Greatest Good for the Greatest Number"
http://www.probe.org/theology-and-philosophy/worldview\--philosophy/utilitarianism-the-greatest-good-for-thegreatest-number.html)

One problem with utilitarianism is that it leads to an \"end justifies
the means\" mentality. If any worthwhile end can justify the means to
attain it, a true ethical foundation is lost. But we all know that the
end does not justify the means. If that were so, then Hitler could
justify the Holocaust because the end was to purify the human race.
Stalin could justify his slaughter of millions because he was trying to
achieve a communist utopia. The end never justifies the means. The means
must justify themselves. A particular act cannot be judged as good
simply because it may lead to a good consequence. The means must be
judged by some objective and consistent standard of morality. Second,
utilitarianism cannot protect the rights of minorities if the goal is
the greatest good for the greatest number. Americans in the eighteenth
century could justify slavery on the basis that it provided a good
consequence for a majority of Americans. Certainly the majority
benefited from cheap slave labor even though the lives of black slaves
were much worse. A third problem with utilitarianism is predicting the
consequences. If morality is based on results, then we would have to
have omniscience in order to accurately predict the consequence of any
action. But at best we can only guess at the future, and often these
educated guesses are wrong. A fourth problem with utilitarianism is that
consequences themselves must be judged. When results occur, we must
still ask whether they are good or bad results. Utilitarianism provides
no objective and consistent foundation to judge results because results
are the mechanism used to judge the action itself.inviolability is
intrinsically valuable.

presumption inherent in the question). **T**he answer 'focuses on the
status conferred on all human beings by the design of a morality which
includes agent-relative constraints' (p.89). That status is one of being
inviolable (which is not, of course, to say that one will not be
violated, but that one may not be violated -- even to minimize the total
number of such violations). A system of morality that includes
inviolability encapsulates a good that its rivals cannot capture**.**
For, **'**not only is it an evil for a person to be harmed in certain
ways, but for it to be permissible to harm the person in those ways is
an additional and independent evil' (p.91). So there is a sense in which
we are better off if there are rights (they are a 'kind of generally
disseminated intrinsic good' (p.93)). Hence there are rights. In short,
we are inviolable because

What does a theory of rights leave undecided? Many issues of public
policy do not affect individual rights, despite frequent ingeniuous
efforts to claim that they do. Such issues pertain to the promotion of a
better life, whether for the disadvantaged or for everyone, or involve
the clash of interests. So long as rights are not in play, advocates of
rights can rightly allow a loose utilitarianism as the proper guide to
public policy, though they should always be eager to keep the state's
energy under suspicion. One can even think, against utilitarianism, that
any substantive outcome acheived by morally proper procedure is morally
right and hence acceptable (so long as rights are not in play). The main
point, however, is that utilitarianism has a necessary place in any
democratic country's normal political deliberations. But its advocates
must know its place, which ordinarily is only to help to decide what
theory of rights leave alone. When may rights be overridden by the
government? I have two sorts of cases in mind: overriding a particular
right of some persons for the sake of preserving the same right of
others, and overriding the same right of everyone for the sake of what I
will clumsily call "civilization values." An advocate of rights could
countenance, perhaps must countenance, the state's overriding of rights
for these two reasons. The subject is painful and liable to dispute
every step of the way. For the state to override-that is, sacrifice- a
right of some so theat others may keep it, the situations must be
desperate. I havein mind, say, circumstances in which the choice is
between sacrificing a right of some and letting a right of all be lost.
The state (or some other agent) may kill some or allow them to be
killed), if the only alternative is letting everyone die. It is the
right to life which most prominently figures in thinking about desperate
situations. I cannot see any resolution but to heed the precept that
numbers count. Just as one may prefer saving one's own life to saving
that of another when both cannot be saved, so a third party-let us say,
the state- can (perhaps must) choose to save the greater number of lives
and at the cost of the lesser number, when there is otherwise no hope
for either group. That choice does not mean that those to be sacrificed
are immoral if they resist being sacrificed. It follows, of course, that
if a third party is right to risk or sacrifice the lives of the lesser
for the lives of the greater number when the lesser would otherwise
live, the lesser are also not wrong if they resist being sacrificed. To
accept utilitarianism (in some loose sense) as a necessary supplement.
It thus should function innocently, or when all hope of innocence is
gone. I emphasize, above all, however, that every care must be taken to
ensure that the precept that numbers of lives count does not become a
license for vaguely conjectural decisions about inflicting death and
saving life and that desperation be as strictly and narrowly understood
as possible. (But total numbers killed do not count if members of one
group have to kill members of another group to save themselves from
threatened massacre of enslavement or utter degradation or misery; they
may kill their attackers in an attempt to end the threat.)

The second area of departure between utilitarianism and rights-based
theories is that ["utilitarians advocate a simple maximising strategy"
as the aim is "to maximise social utility and a society is justified in
doing whatever enhances its aggregate utility]{.underline}" (Jones,
1994: 52). Conversely, the opponents of this view hold [that rights
constitute an area which is beyond the reach of such calculations, as it
would be pointless if rights could be "set aside in a mere calculus of
competing preferences]{.underline}" (Jones, 1994: 53). This is because
rights are regarded as being considerations which are special in the
sense that they protect individuals from the potential excesses of such
calculations. Consequently, to refer back to Gewirth's example,
according to the rights-based account, it would always be morally wrong
to torture an innocent person, even if this would result in a large
increase in aggregate utility in such a society, while a utilitarian
approach would weigh up the evidence, such that if thousands of lives
would be saved by the torture, then it ought to be done. [This roughly
reflects Dworkin's notion of "Rights as Trumps" which override, or
supersede ordinary notions of well-being. The difference however is that
Dworkin's theory occupies some middle ground, as it does not rule out
rights being overridden by such considerations when other fundamental
rights are threatened]{.underline} (Jones, 1994: 53). So while Dworkin
would probably argue that to torture someone to give others in society
pleasure at the sight would be trumped by the right not to be tortured,
he would perhaps concede that to [torture an individual to prevent the
detonation of a nuclear bomb, as is the case in Gewirth's example, may
be justified, as the right to life of all others in society may, in this
instance, trump the right of an individual not to be
tortured]{.underline}. Dworkin's formulation again places [the domain of
rights beyond the reach of ordinary considerations of utility, but he
does make provision for rights to be balanced against one another (to
"trump" one another) in cases of extreme gravity *for rights*
themselves]{.underline}. Consequently, theories of rights quite simply
consider respect for rights to be the primary consideration in the
course of social deliberation, [while utilitarians consider the ultimate
"good" or "utility" on the balance to be the correct goal to pursue,
even if this potentially infringes on individual rights]{.underline}.
However[, assertions that these conceptions of justice are incompatible
are not always acknowledged by exponents of
consequentialism.]{.underline} As Richard B. Brandt states: "[There is a
fundamental incompatibility between utilitarianism and human rights.
Most utilitarians of course have not thought there is such an
incompatibility]{.underline}" (Brandt, 1992: 196).

## Evaluating the deontological aspects of a policy is critical to policy making {#evaluating-the-deontological-aspects-of-a-policy-is-critical-to-policy-making .Tags}

**Pinstrup-Andersen, 2005**. \[Ethics and economic policy for the food
system. General Sessions, 01-

DEC-05, American Journal of Agricultural Economics Ebsco Host.\]

Economists seldom address ethical questions as they infringe on economic
theory or economic

behavior. They (and I) find this subject complex and elusive in
comparison with the relative precision and

objectivity of economic analysis. However, if ethics is influencing our
analyses but ignored, is the precision and objectivity just an illusion?
Are we in fact being normative when we claim to be positive or are we,
as suggested by Gilbert

(p. xvi), ignoring social ethics and, as a consequence, contributing to
a situation in which we know \"the

price of everything and the value of nothing?\" The economists\' focus
on efficiency and the Pareto

Principle has made us less relevant to policy makers, whose main
concerns are who gains, who

loses, by how much, and can or should the losers be compensated. By
focusing on the

distribution of gains and losses and replacing the Pareto Principle with
estimates of whether a big

enough economic surplus could be generated so that gainers could
compensate losers, the socalled

new welfare economics (which is no longer new) was a step toward more
relevancy for policy

makers (Just, Hueth, and Schmitz). Another major step toward relevancy
was made by the more recent

emphasis on political economy and institutional economics. But are we
trading off scientific validity for

relevancy? Robbins (p. 9) seems to think so, when he states that
\"claims of welfare economics to be

scientific are highly dubious.\" But if Aristotle saw economics as a
branch of ethics and Adam Smith was a moral philosopher, when did we, as
implied by Stigler, replace ethics with precision and objectivity? Or,
when did we as economists move away from philosophy toward statistics
and engineering and are we on our way back to a more

comprehensive political economy approach, in which both quantitative and
qualitative variables are taken

into account? I believe we are. Does that make us less scientific, as
argued by Robbins?

I am not questioning whether the quantification of economic
relationships is important. It is. In the case of food policy analysis,
it is critically important that the causal relationship between policy
options and expected impact on the population groups of interest is
quantitatively estimated. But not at the expense of reality, context,
and ethical considerations, much of which can be described only in
qualitative terms. Economic analyses that ignore everything that cannot
be quantified and included in our models are not likely to advance our
understanding of economic and policy relationships. Neither

will they be relevant for solving real world problems. The predictive
ability is likely to be low and,

if the results are used by policy makers, the outcome may be different
from what was expecte.

there is another sense of disrespect tied to the fact that we owe people
more respect than animals, even though we also should not treat animals
in an unjustified way. And this other sense of disrespect is, I believe,
tied to the failure to heed the greater inviolability of persons.

that echoes Mill's famous principle of

utility. **But** Kant's duty to promote beneficial consequences is
understood to be derived from an even

higher order principle, namely, the categorical imperative that requires
all of us to act in a way that

respects the intrinsic value of other rational beings. Kant does not

**[A RECENT correspondent]{.underline}**, after praising the position I
took in opposition to Garrett Hardin\'s \"Life-boat Ethic\" (\"Doing
Good by Doing Well,\" Dec. 1974), ended her letter with a complaint. I
had, she implied, fallen into a fatal trap by trying to argue with
Hardin's thesis on \"rationalistic rounds. The issue at stake is
\"humanitarianism\" and the future of altruism, neither of which will be
saved if they must be defended on the narrow base of reason and logic.
Indeed, she **[seemed to be saying, there is an inherent conflict
between humanitarianism and rationalism.]{.underline}** As an
unreconstructed rationalist, **[I balk at admitting such a dualism, just
as I rebel at the general black-balling of reason and
logic]{.underline}** which seems to many to offer the only antidote to
the generally insane, depressing state of the world. One can well
understand how rationality has come to have a bad name. We have in the
twentieth century been subjected to endless wars, ills and disasters
carried out in the name of somebody or other\'s impeccable logic and
assertedly rational deliberations. One can also understand the sense of
distaste any feel in the face of articulate proponents of \"triage\" in
our dealings with poor countries and a \"lifeboat ethic\" in
deter-mining our own moral responsibilities toward the starving,
particularly when such positions are advanced in the name of no-nonsense
rational calculation. For all that, **[I am far more fearful of a
deliberate abandonment of reason than of the evils which can be done in
its name.]{.underline}** **[The fault with the latter form of attacking
\"reason\" is that it takes those arguing in its name too much at their
own word. Poke around a bit under the facade of carefully-honed
rationality and precise logical moves and what does one usually
discover? Pure mush. Those vast, intricate edifices rest on a bowl of
porridge, made up of irrational self-interest, the worst forms of
sentimentality (or pure cruelty), utterly unanalyzed assumptions about
politics, or ethics,]{.underline}** or human nature, tribalism, and
**[god knows what else. None of that has much if anything to do with
reason.]{.underline} [A recent article by Robert]{.underline}** L.
**[Heilbroner]{.underline}**, author of the much-acclaimed book, An
Inquiry Into the Human Prospect, **[is indicative of the muddle created
when one calls for an abandonment of rationality in favor of something
more Illuminating]{.underline}**. In \"What has Posterity Ever Done for
Me?\" (New York Times Magazine, January 19, 1975), Prof. Heilbroner
tries to make the case that contemporary human beings will never learn
to take responsibility for the future of mankind until they give up
trying to find a compelling reason why they should. Only some
fundamental revelatory experience-to wit, famine, war and the like-will
bring people back to what is an essentially \"religious\" insight, that
of \"the transcendent importance of posterity for them.\" It is
intriguing to see the way Heilbroner develops his case. \"Why,\" he
asks, \"should I lift a finger to affect events that will have no more
meaning for me 75 years after my death than those that happened 75 years
before I was born? There is no rational answer to that terrible
question. No argument based on reason will lead me to care for posterity
or to lift a finger in its behalf. Indeed, by every rational
consideration, precisely the opposite answer is thrust upon us with
irresistible force.\" Going on, Heilbroner quotes an anonymous
\"Distinguished Younger Economist\" who has concluded that he really
doesn\'t \"care\" whether mankind survives or not. \"Is this,\"
Heilbroner queries, \"an outrageous position? I must confess it outrages
me. But this is not because the economist\'s arguments are
\'wrong\'-indeed, within their rational framework they are indisputably
right. It is because their position reveals the limitations-worse, the
suicidal dangers-of what we call \'rational argument\' when we con-front
questions that can only be decided by an appeal to an entirely different
faculty from that of cool reason.\" **[I find]{.underline}**
**[Heilbroner\'s despair at finding a rational basis to care about
posterity]{.underline}**, or the distant past, **[simply
startling]{.underline}**. Surely, to begin with the past, he can hardly
believe (to stick to his own field of economics) that Adam Smith and the
other \"worldly philosophers\" have no significance whatever any more,
despite the fact that they had a critical place in shaping the world in
which we live today. And surely, as an American, he must find some
slight trace of present and personal meaning in the historical fact that
some distant people once upon a time signed a \"declaration of
independence.\" My beginning with the past is no accident. If a case is
to be made for caring about the fate of posterity, it will arise out of
the highly rational recognition that (for better or worse) we are where
we are because it seemed to our ancestors only sensible to worry about
the fate of their descendants, just as (also for better or worse) still
earlier generations had worried about their descendants. More deeply,
unless one has decided that human life is, regardless of its condition,
meaningless and terrible-in which case, what the hell-one will also
recognize the moral interdependence of generations as one of the
conditions for extracting whatever possibilities there are for human
happiness. To love and believe in life at all is not just to love one\'s
own life; it is to love both the fact and idea of life itself, including
the life of those yet to be born. My point here, however, is not to make
the rational case for obligations toward posterity. It is only to
indicate there are rational ways of going about it (and if you don\'t
like the reasons I\'ve given, I can think of still others), just as
**[there]{.underline}** **[are rational ways of establishing a variety
of]{.underline}** other **[moral duties]{.underline}**. **[The truly
hazardous part of despairing of reason, and longing for a return to
something more primitive, can readily be seen in the]{.underline}**
texture of some of Heilbroner\'s other arguments. He is looking for what
he calls the \"**[survivalist\" principle]{.underline}**, by which he
seems to mean some deep sense of obligation toward the future, powerful
enough to give us the courage and the toughness to take those immediate
steps necessary to discharge our obligation. \"Of course,\" he writes,
\"there are moral dilemmas to be faced even if one takes one\'s stand on
the \'survivalist\' principle\.... \[But\] this essential commitment to
life\'s continuance gives us the moral authority to take measures,
per-haps very harsh measures, whose justification cannot be found in the
precepts of rationality, but must be sought in the unbearable anguish we
feel if we imagine ourselves as the executioner of mankind.\" Of course
we may have to act harshly. But, to bring the circle full turn, how are
we to act harshly, to whom and under what circumstances? Are we also
meant to abandon reason in trying to answer that question? **[Are we
supposed to solve]{.underline}** the **[evident \"moral
dilemmas]{.underline}**\" to which Heilbroner refers **[by a dependence,
not on reason, but on a sense of \"unbearable anguish]{.underline}**\"?I
see no reason to hope that even a fully shared sense of anguish would
tell us how to resolve moral dilemmas. Moreover, Heilbroner himself
cites at least one person who does not share his feelings, and unless we
are to suppose that person to represent a class of one, the pillar to
the center of the earth Heilbroner offers us begins to look like a piece
of balsa wood. The amusing side of all this is that the two principal
\"survivalists\" of our day, Garrett Hardin and Robert Heilbroner, seem
to come out at opposite poles in the place they give to reason. Hardin
appears the very paradigm of that cool rationality which Heilbroner
believes to be our greatest threat to survival. And Heilbroner\'s quest
for some deeper affective, \"religious\" motivation for survival seems
the very model of that soft-hearted and woolly-headed humanitarianism
which Hardin identifies as the villain. Neither is likely to carry the
day, and for very healthy reasons. **[Heilbroner is correct when he
discerns that the appeal to reason has its limitations. It takes more
than mere logic to move people deeply, especially to move them to
act.]{.underline}** More than that, the frequently indignant reaction
which greeted Hardin\'s \"lifeboat ethic\" indicates that many are not
about to adopt a policy of calculating callousness, \"logical\" though
that may seem. Hardin is correct when he says that we must think very
hard about the question of survival, however much such thought may end
by posing hard, even revolting, choices. But he seems not to have
realized that, unless the drive for survival has a moral basis and a
saving reference to some-thing deeper than rational calculation, some
and perhaps many people will decide that survival at any price is not a
moral good. **[Nothing]{.underline}** I have said here **[solves the
vexing problem of the right relationship between reason and feeling in
the moral life. But it seems to me at least clear that the worst
possible solution is to choose one at the expense of the other, or to
think that we can make a flat choice between them. There is enough
evidence from recent psychological research to indicate that our
feelings and emotions are vigorously]{.underline}** tutored by our
perceptions and cognition; reason has its say even in the way we feel. A
no less important insight is that there is all the difference in the
world between being \"rational "and being \"logical.\"Almost anyone can
work through a simple syllogism, presuming he is spared the ordeal of
worrying about whether the premises are correct. It is a far more
difficult matter to be rational, particularly where ethics is concerned

It may appear that I am defending Kantian deontology as a comprehensive
moral language to use in interpreting international events. But I mean
not to assert that **Kantian deontology** is sufficient, only that it is
necessary. Such a perspective contributes fundamental, often neglected,
insights. First it **provides a moral grounding for any rights-based
approach to international affairs.** This includes not only the general
interpretation of international policy through broad notions of human
rights, but also the application of specific rights such as those found
in the *UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights**.*** **Indeed, most
contemporary rights-based theories are deontological theories.** Rights
are principles that assign claims or entitlements to someone against
someone and are usually interpreted as "trumping" or taking precedence
over consequential claims made in the name of collective welfare.4
Hence, both in their similarity of form (as a principle universally
applicable to relevantly similar situations) and in their similarity of
function (as taking precedence over collective, consequential
considerations), rights satisfy two key Kantian-deontological criteria.
Second, **Kantianism entails clear restrictions on the general behavior
of states. Of greatest importance is the fact that these restrictions
alert us to the danger of letting the ends justify the means. Whatever
the flaws of the Kantian deontological tradition, and no matter what
verdict we finally reach on the comprehensiveness of deontological moral
logic, the insistence on principle over mere calculation of future
consequences stands as deontology's practical raison d'etre. Deontology
may not be sufficient, but it is necessary for a humane international
order.**

Igor **Primoratz** in **05** (Principal Research Fellow @ Center for
Applied Philosophy amd Public Ethics, The

Philosophical Forum, Volume 36, No. 1, "Civilian Immunity in War",
Spring, p. 44-46)

**Consequentialist thinkers** usually present their view on civilian
immunity against the background of a critique of attempts of
philosophers and legal thinkers to account for civilian immunity in
deontological terms. Having satisfied themselves that those attempts
have been unsuccessful, they **put forward the claim that civilian
immunity has nothing to do with civilians' acts or omissions, guilt or
innocence, responsibility or lack of it, but is merely a useful
convention.** It is useful since it rules out targeting a large group of
human beings, and thus helps reduce greatly the overall killing, mayhem,
and destruction in war. **The consequentialist view of civilian immunity
is exposed to two objections: the protection it offers to civilians is
too weak, and the ground provided for it indicates a misunderstanding of
the moral issue involved**. The protection is too weak because civilian
immunity is understood as but a useful convention. This makes it doubly
weak. First, **if it is merely a useful convention, if all its moral
force is due to its utility, then it will have no such force in cases
where it has no utility.** This is a familiar flaw of consequentialism.
It denies that moral rules have any intrinsic moral significance, and
explains their binding force solely in terms of the good consequences of
acting in accordance with them. Therefore **it cannot give us any good
consequentialist reason to adhere to a moral rule in cases where
adhering to it will not have the good consequences it usually has, and
where better consequences will be attained by going against the rule**.6
This means that we should respect civilian immunity when, and only when,
doing so will have the good consequences adduced as its ground: when it
will indeed reduce the overall killing, maiming, and destruction. On the
other hand, whenever we have good reasons to believe that, by targeting
civilians, we shall make a significant contribution to our war effort,
thus shortening the war and reducing the overall killing and mayhem,
that is what we may and indeed ought to do. **Civilian immunity is thus
made hostage to the vagaries of war, instead of providing civilians with
iron-clad protection against them. This is not a purely theoretical
concern.** As Kai Nielsen has pointed out, systematic attacks on
civilians in the course of a war of national liberation can make an
indispensable contribution to the successful prosecution of such a war.
That was indeed the case in Algeria and South Vietnam, and may well have
been the case in Angola and Mozambique as well. Then again, **if
civilian immunity is merely a useful convention, that weakens it by
making it hostage to the stance taken by enemy political and military
leadership. They may or may not choose to respect the immunity of our
civilians. If they do not, on the consequentialist view of this
immunity, we are not bound to respect the immunity of their civilians.**
Being a convention, it binds only if, or as long as, it is accepted by
both parties to the conflict. As an important statement of this view
puts it, "for convention-dependent obligations, what one's opponent
does, what 'everyone is doing,' etc., are facts of great moral
importance. Such facts help to determine within what convention, if any,
one is operating, and thus they help one discover what his moral duties
are."8 To be sure, even if no such convention is in place, but we have
reason to believe we can help bring about its acceptance by unilaterally
acting in accordance with it and thereby encouraging the enemy to do the
same, we should do that. But if we have no good reason to believe that,
or if we have tried that approach and it has failed, our military are
free to kill and maim enemy civilians whenever they feel they need to do
that. **Thus our moral choice is determined, be it directly or
ultimately, by the moral (or immoral) choice of enemy political and
military leaders. So is the fate of enemy civilians. The fact that they
are civilians, in itself, counts for nothing**. This brings me to the
second objection: **The consequentialist misses what anyone else,** and
in particular any civilian in wartime, **would consider the crux of the
matter**. Faced with the prospect of being killed or maimed by enemy
fire, **a civilian would not make her case in terms of disutility of
killing or maiming civilians in war in general, or of killing or maiming
her then and there. She would rather point out that she is a** civilian,
not a soldier; a bystander, not a participant; an i**nnocent**, not a
guilty party. She would point out that **she has done nothing to
deserve, or become liable to, such a fate. She would present these
personal** facts as considerations whose moral significance is intrinsic
and decisive, rather than instrumental and **fortuitous**, mediated by a
useful convention (which, in different circumstances, might enjoin
limiting war by targeting only civilians). And **her argument, couched
in personal terms, would seem to be more to the point than the
impersonal calculation of good and bad consequences by means of which
the consequentialist would settle the matter.**

## Recognizing rights and putting them before a utilitarian calculus is the only rational and {#recognizing-rights-and-putting-them-before-a-utilitarian-calculus-is-the-only-rational-and .Tags}

**moral option.**

H. L. A. **Hart** in **79** (former principal of Oxford University,
Tulane Law Review, "The Shell Foundation Lectures,

1978-1979: Utilitarianism and Natural Rights", April, 53 Tul. L. Rev.
663, l/n)

Accordingly, the contemporary modern philosophers of whom I have spoken,
and preeminently Rawls in his *Theory of Justice*, have argued that
**any morally adequate political philosophy must recognise that there
must be, in any morally tolerable form of social life, certain
protections for the freedom and basic interests of individuals** which
constitute an essential framework of individual rights. **Though the
pursuit of the general welfare is indeed a legitimate and indeed
necessary concern** of governments, **it is something to be pursued only
within certain constraints imposed by recognition of such rights.** The
modern philosophical defence put forward for the recognition of basic
human rights does not wear the same metaphysical or conceptual dress as
the earlier doctrines of the seventeenth and eighteenth-century Rights
of Man, which men were said to have in a state of nature or to be
endowed with by their creator. Nonetheless, the most complete and
articulate version of this modern critique of Utilitarianism has many
affinities with the theories of social contract which in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries accompanied the doctrine of natural rights.
Thus Rawls has argued in *A Theory of Justice* that **though any
rational person must know that in order to live even a minimally
tolerable life he must live within a political society with an ordered
government, no rational person bargaining with others on a footing of**
\[\*679\] **equality could agree to regard himself as bound to obey the
laws of any government if his freedom and basic interests**, what Mill
called \"the groundwork of human existence,\" **were not given
protection and treated as having priority over mere increases in
aggregate welfare** even if the protection cannot be absolute.

## Deontological principles of rights should be considered first -- other interpretations are assigned no moral value if conflicting with the principles of rights because viewing the debate from a deontological perspective is the only way to guarantee freedom {#deontological-principles-of-rights-should-be-considered-first-other-interpretations-are-assigned-no-moral-value-if-conflicting-with-the-principles-of-rights-because-viewing-the-debate-from-a-deontological-perspective-is-the-only-way-to-guarantee-freedom .Tags}

[The priority of right asserts then that the reasons supplied by moral
motives-principles of right and their institutional requirements-have
absolute precedence over all other considerations]{.underline}**.** As
such, moral motives must occupy a separate dimension in practical
reasoning. [Suppose]{.underline} then a supplementary stage of practical
reasoning, [where the interests and pursuits that figure into ordinary
deliberation and]{.underline} which define [our conception of the good
are checked against principles of right and justice. At this stage of
reasoning, any ends that directly conflict with these moral principles
(e.g., racist ends or the wish to dominate others]{.underline}), or
whose pursuit would undermine the efficacy of principles of right (e.g.,
desires for unlimited accumulation of wealth whatever the consequences
for others), [are assigned no moral value, no matter how intensely felt
or important they may otherwise be]{.underline}. Being without moral
value, they count for nothing in deliberation. [Consequently, their
pursuit is prohibited or curtailed by the priority given to principles
of right]{.underline}. The priority of right then describes the
hierarchical subordination in practical deliberation of the desires,
interests, and plans that define a person\'s rational good, to the
substantive demands of principles of right.32 Purposes and pursuits that
are incompatible with these principles must be abandoned or revised. The
same idea carries through to social and political deliberations on the
general good. In political deliberative procedures, the priority of
right means that desires and interests of individuals or groups that
conflict with the institutional requirements of principles of right and
justice have no legitimate claim to satisfaction, no matter how intense
peoples\' feelings or how large the majority sharing these aims.
Constitutional restrictions on majority rule exhibit the priority of
right. In democratic procedures, majorities cannot violate
constitutional rights and procedures to promote, say, the Christian
religion, or any other aspect of their good that undermines others\'
basic rights and opportunities. Similarly, the institutional
requirements of Rawls\'s difference principle limit, for example,
property owners\' desires for tax exemptions for capital gains, and the
just savings principle limits current majorities\' wishes to deplete
natural resources. These desires are curtailed in political contexts, no
matter how intense or widely held, because of the priority of principles
of right over individual and general good.33 The priority of right
enables Rawls to define a notion of admissible conceptions of the good:
of those desires, interests and plans of life that may legitimately be
pursued for political purposes. [Only admissible conceptions of the good
establish a basis for legitimate claims in political
procedures]{.underline} (cf. TJ, p. 449). [That certain desires and
pursuits are permissible, and political claims based on them are
legitimate, while others are not, presupposes antecedently established
principles of right and justice.]{.underline} Racist conceptions of the
good are not politically admissible; actions done in their pursuit are
either prohibited or discouraged by a just social scheme, and they
provide no basis for legitimate claims in political procedures.
Excellences such as knowledge, creativity, and aesthetic contemplation
are permissible ends for individuals so long as they are pursued in
accordance with the constraints of principles of right. Suppose these
perfectionist principles state intrinsic values that it is the duty of
everyone to pursue. (Rawls leaves this question open. cf. TJ, p. 328.)
[Still, they cannot supply a basis for legitimate political claims and
expectations; they cannot be appealed to in political contexts to
justify limiting others\' freedom, or even the coercive redistribution
of income and wealth]{.underline} (cf. TJ, pp. 331-32). This is because
of the priority of right over the good. Now return to Kymlicka\'s
argument. Kymlicka says both Rawls and utilitarians agree on the premise
of giving equal consideration to everyone\'s interests, and that because
utilitarians afford equal consideration, \"they must recognize, rather
than deny, that individuals are distinct persons with their own rightful
claims. That is, in Rawls\'s classification, a position that affirms the
priority of the right over the good\" (LCC, p. 26). Since \"Rawls treats
the right as a spelling-out of the requirement that each person\'s good
be given equal consideration,\" there is no debate between Rawls and
utilitarians over the priority of the right or the good (LCC, p. 40).

The rights tradition and utilitarianism, the two grand opponents in
American jurisprudence, clash on many different issues and fronts.235
There are, however, many ways to classify ethical theories, and in one
crucial respect these two belong together. They seek the same kind of
answer to the question of conflicting values. For its part,
utilitarianism aspires to clear and unique answers for every question of
public choice. If only we can determine the various utility functions of
individuals affected by those decisions-a heroic assumption-the
absolutely correct action will be known[. Utilitarianism employs a
method for producing that absolute answer that threatens to obliterate
the individual, and hence rights theories reject that method. In
affirming the primacy of the individual,]{.underline} however, [those
theories do not abandon utilitarianism\'s ultimate objective to identify
absolutes-clear and definite answers-to guide social choice or to
determine the constraints of justice.]{.underline} In this respect, such
theories still live in utilitarianism\'s shadow.

Mill is especially helpful in responding to the communitarian critique
of respect for autonomy because he is careful to emphasize that his
[conception of liberty is neither selfish nor indifferent to the
self-regarding behavior of others. Mill]{.underline} (1978 \[1859\], pp.
74-75) [identifies a number of ways in which members of the community
should influence each other toward the \"self-regarding virtues,\" which
include education, conviction, persuasion, encouragement, and advice.
However, he rejects the coercion of the law]{.underline} and the
overwhelming power of public opinion [as illegitimate forms of control
over self-regarding conduct]{.underline} (Mill 1978 \[1859\], p. 9). The
practical application of these principles from Kant and Mill does not
require a concept of the self as unencumbered or isolated in its
decision making. [Kant\'s concept of the person]{.underline}, with the
capacity for rational \[End Page 340\] agency, [is based on human
freedom from natural forces, not our freedom from attachments and
commitments to other persons or]{.underline} the influence our
histories, traditions, and families have on [our values, choices, and
actions.]{.underline} Kant is pointing out that we are neither like
chairs, without the capacity for choice or action, nor like nonrational
animals, whose actions are determined by instinct and the forces of
nature. As persons, we are the products of our families, traditions, and
communities. Yet, because we are persons, our actions may be the result
of more than these influences. They may also be the result of our
rational capacities. Moreover, according to Kant, [our choices and
actions are not supposed to be based simply on our own goals and ends.
Rather, Kant believes that the moral law will lead us to recognize
duties and obligations we have to others]{.underline}, for example, to
respect and further their [ends. Such obligations could certainly be
directed toward the shared goals of the community as a
whole]{.underline}. For Mill, even self-regarding choices and actions
are properly subject to influence from others, for example through their
natural reactions to an individual\'s self-destructive behavior. In
fact, he [advocates our responsibility to help each other]{.underline}
\". . . distinguish the better from the worse . . .\" through
conviction, encouragement, persuasion, and education (Mill 1978
\[1859\], pp. 74-76). Furthermore, in the category of other-regarding
behavior Mill includes the risk of damage not only to specific others,
but to the society, as well (p. 80).

[Given the philosophical obstacles to resolving moral disputes, there
are at least two approaches one can take in dealing with the issue of
the morality of nuclear strategy]{.underline}. One approach is to stick
doggedly with one of the established moral theories constructed by
philosophers to "rationalize" or "make sense of" everyday moral
intuitions, and to accept the verdict of the theory, whatever it might
be, on the morality of nuclear weapons use. [A more pragmatic
alternative approach assumes that trade-offs in moral values and
principles are inevitable in response to constantly changing
threats]{.underline}, and that the emergence of novel, [unforeseen
challenges may impel citizens of Western societies to adjust the way
they rank their values and principles to ensure that the moral order
survives]{.underline}. Nuclear weapons are putting just such a strain on
our moral beliefs. Before the emergence of a nuclear-armed communist
state capable of threatening the existence of Western civilization, the
slaughter of millions of innocent human beings to preserve Western
values may have appeared wholly unjustifiable under any possible
circumstances. [Today, however, it may be that Western democracies, if
they are to survive as guardians of individual freedom, can no longer
afford to provide innocent life the full protection demanded by Just War
morality]{.underline}. It might be objected that the [freedoms of
Western society have value only on the assumption that human beings are
treated with the full dignity and respect]{.underline} assumed by Just
War theory. Innocent human life is not just another value to be balanced
side by side with others in moral calculations. It is the raison d'etre
of Western political, economic, and social institutions. [A free society
based on individual rights that sanctioned mass slaughter of innocent
human beings to save itself from extinction would be "morally
corrupt,"]{.underline} no better than soviet society, and not worth
defending. [The only morally right and respectable policy for such a
society would be to accept destruction at the hands of
tyranny]{.underline}, if need be. This objection is partly right in that
a society based on individual rights that casually sacrifices innocent
human lives for the sake of common social goods is a contradiction in
terms. On the other hand, even Just War doctrine allows for the
unintentional sacrifice of some innocent human life under certain
hard-pressing circumstances. It is essentially a consequentialist moral
doctrine that ascribes extremely high -- but not absolute -- value to
innocent human life. The problem for any nonabsolute moral theory, of
course, is where to draw the line.

Shue 89 (Henry, Professor of Ethics and Public Life, Princeton

But is it realistic to suppose that American citizens would risk not
just their own lives but their families and their nation in using
nuclear weapons to save Western Europe and other free societies from
Soviet domination, especially if the United States' allies are not
willing to risk nuclear destruction themselves? According to one 1984
poll, 74 percent of Americans queried believe "the U.S. should not use
nuclear weapons if the Russians invade Western Europe." Nuclear
Protectionists, however, would reply that further public debate might
convince more Americans that deterrence cannot be had on the moral
cheap. [If the United States is determined to deter a Soviet attack on
Europe, it must have a moral nuclear strategy that it is willing to
implement]{.underline}. Without effective population defenses[, such a
strategy could require that the United States accept an unequal risk of
nuclear destruction to ensure the survival of free society.]{.underline}
In the extreme, this could mean that [the United States must be willing
to sacrifice itself for values higher than its own national
survival.]{.underline} Thus, Nuclear Protectionism views both Just War
morality and national "self-centered" as unworkable foundations for U.S.
security policy.

Mohan 93 -- Professor at LSU (Brij, "Eclipse Of Freedom," p. 3-4)

[The ordeal of existence transcends the thermonuclear fever because the
latter does not directly impact the day-to-day operations of the common
people. The fear of crime, accidents, loss of job, and health care on
the one hand; and the scourges of racism, sexism, and agism on the other
hand have created a counterculture of denial and disbelief that has
shattered the façade of civility. Civilization loses its significance
when its social institutions have become counterproductive]{.underline}.
It is the aspect of the mega-crisis that we are concerned about. The
"ordeal of existence", as I see it, has three relevant facets: Crisis of
modernity, Contradictions of paradigms, Complexity of social phenomenon.
Reinventing civility calls for an exposition of these elements without a
vituperative intent. Each of these aspects has normative and structural
dimension involving a host of theories. The politics, metaphors, and
rhetoric, however, color the shape and substance of each analytical
output. Therefore[, a value-neutral assessment cannot be a politically
correct statement on the human condition.]{.underline}

Many moral views can admit that right acts in some sense promote the
good. In Kant, for example, all have a duty to promote the Realm of
Ends; each person\'s doing so is, we might say, instrumental to
realizing this ideal community. But here the goodness of this end is not
an independent variable that is being promoted; this [good is just
defined as the state of affairs in which conscientious moral agents all
freely act on and from the moral law. By acting and willing according to
this principle, all treat the humanity of others as an end in itself.
Moreover, to say this good is \"maximized\" when everyone does his or
her duty really adds nothing; and it misleads us as to the structure and
content of Kant\'s principle of right.]{.underline} By contrast
[teleological views (1) define the good independent of any moral
concepts; and then (2) define the right purely in instrumental terms of
principles of expedience]{.underline}, i.e., [as what most effectively
and probably realizes the greatest amount of good.]{.underline}

Phillipa Foot has said that what makes consequentialism so compeling is
\"the rather simple thought that it can never be right to prefer a worse
state of affairs to a better.\"5 But deontological theories, suitably
construed, can account for this \"simple thought\" just as well (for
reasons I discuss in Section VI). The force of consequentialism must
then ie elsewhere: it embodies a powerful conception of practical
reason. If we assume that rationality consists in maximizing an
aggregate, and that in ethics it involves maximizing overall good, then
we are able to say that there is a rational choice between any two
alternative actions, laws, or institutions. Therefore [under all
conceivable conditions, there is a uniquely rational, hence right, thing
to do.]{.underline} Granted, it may not be knowable by us, but [the idea
of maximizing the good provides a way to assign a truth value to any
statement about what persons or groups ought to do. No other conception
of rationality offers such practical completeness. Sidgwick, well aware
of the force of the idea of maximizing an aggregate, used it quite
effectively to argue that hedonism must be true, and that
rational]{.underline} egoism and utilitarianism were the only two
\"rational methods\" in ethics.6 He could not decide which of the two
was more rational, but assuming that egoism is not a moral conception at
all, then, given Sidgwick\'s premises, utilitarianism prevails without
opposition. These introductory remarks supply background I later refer
to. My aim is to elucidate the teleology/deontology distinction. I begin
with the contention that teleological theories are not moral theories at
all. Will Kymlicka argues that the teleological/deontological
distinction relied on by Rawls and others is misleading. Not only does
the morally right act not maximize the good; any view which defines the
right in this way is not a moral conception.7 Right actions, Kymlicka
says, concern our duties, and duties must be owed to someone. But if
moral duty is defined as maximizing overall good, \"Whom is it a duty
to?\" (LCC, p. 28). Kymlicka argues for the (Kantian) claim that
morality concerns respect for persons, not the good impersonally
construed. And the most credible moral conceptions, the only ones worth
attending to, hold that \"each person matters equally,\" and deserves
equal concern and respect (LCC, p. 40). Kymlicka\'s aim here is not to
attack teleological views, but to show that Rawls\'s
teleological/deontological distinction cannot do the work Rawls wants;
indeed it is \"based on a serious confusion\" (LCC, p. 21). For
utilitarians, Kymlicka claims, are just as committed to equality, equal
respect for persons, and fair distributions as everyone else. The
difference is they interpret these abstract concepts differently. Here
Kymlicka follows Ronald Dworkin\'s suggestion: \"that Rawls and his
critics all share the same \'egalitarian plateau\': they agree that
\'the interests of the members of the community matter, and matter
equally\"\' (LCC, p. 21). Utilitarians like Hare and Harsanyi,
non-utilitarians like Rawls, Nozick, and Dworkin, and even many
Perfectionists (Kymlicka mentions Marx), [all accept that equal concern
and respect is the fundamental moral principle. \"All these theories are
deontological in that they spell out an ideal of fairness or equality
for distinct individuals]{.underline}\" (LCC, p. 26). If so, Kymlicka
argues, the dispute between utilitarians and their critics cannot be
depicted in terms of Rawls\'s misleading distinction, or in terms of the
priority of the right or the good. At issue in these debates are
different conceptions of the political value of equality. I shall argue
(in Sections II and III) that [Kymlicka,]{.underline} not Rawls, is
culpable of \"serious confusion.\" He [confuses deontology-a claim about
the content of principles of right-with the principles that are invoked
in justifying and applying the content of a moral view.]{.underline}
Moreover, he confuses deontology with a related idea, the priority of
right. The priority of right has received a great deal of attention from
Rawls\'s communitarian critics. This is surprising in view of the fact
that Rawls has so little to say about it in Theory ofJustice.8

[It is perhaps a moral truism to say that people ought to do what they
can to make the world as good a place as possible.]{.underline} But
construed in a certain way, this becomes a highly controversial thesis
about morality: that the right act in any circumstance is one most
conducive to the best overall outcome (as ascertained, say, from an
impersonal point of view that gives equal weight to the good of
everyone). This is Consequentialism.\' More simply, it holds Right
conduct maximizes the Good. G. E. Moore held this thesis self-evident.
Non-consequentialists argue nothing could be further from the truth. [So
far as they do, it appears (to consequentialists at least) they are
committed to the indefensible idea that morality requires us to do less
good than we are able to.]{.underline} John [Rawls\']{.underline}s
teleological/[deontological distinction is different.]{.underline} Teleo
logical views affirm the consequentialist thesis that the Right
maximizes the Good. But they hold an additional thesis: \"the good is
defined independently from the right\" (TJ, p. 24), or, as Rawls often
says, independ ent of any moral concepts or principles.2 To see how this
view differs from consequentialism, consider a thesis once proposed by
T. M. Scanlon.[3 A standard objection to]{.underline} consequentialist
views like [utilitarian ism is that they are indifferent to the
distribution of the good; this is purportedly a necessary feature of
such views, since they define right and justice as what maximizes
overall, or aggregate, good.]{.underline} Scanlon argued there should be
a way to incorporate distributive concerns into a two-level
consequentialist view. If we treat fairness or distributive equality as
a good in itself, then it must be considered along with other goods like
net aggregate satisfaction in determining the value of overall outcomes
that are to be maximized. Rights could then be introduced at the level
of casuistry, to promote the good of equitable states of affairs. The
two-level consequentialist view Scanlon suggests would not be
teleological on Rawls\'s account; it would be deontological. As Rawls
says: If the distribution of goods is also counted as a good, perhaps a
higher-order one, and the theory directs us to produce the most good
(including the good of distribution among others) we no longer have a
teleological view in the classical sense. The problem of distribution
falls under the concept of right as one intuitively understands it, and
so the theory lacks an independent definition of the good. (TJ, 27)

[Rawls\'s thought may be this: in order to define the distributions
(e.g., equal states of affairs) that are intrinsically
good]{.underline}, and then practically apply this definition to
determine what we ought to do, [we must appeal to]{.underline} some
process of distribution that can only be described by antecedent
[principles of right or justice. But once we do that, then it is no
longer the case that the right is exclusively defined in terms of what
maximizes the good]{.underline}. For example, suppose fairness or the
equal capacity of persons to realize their good is among the intrinsic
[goods in a consequentialist view: we are to act in whatever ways best
promote fairness or equality of capacity for all persons. It is
difficult to see how such vague ends can be specified for practical
purposes without appealing to principles or procedures defining
peoples\' equal basic rights, powers, and entitlements. But once this
specification is incorporated into the maximand, the right is no longer
simply a matter of maximizing the good]{.underline}. For
[the]{.underline} concept of the good itself, in this instance, cannot
be described without an antecedent nonmaximizing [moral principle of
right: that people ought to be treated fairly, afforded certain basic
rights and powers, and so on]{.underline}. Not only is [such a
view]{.underline} by Rawls\'s definition nonteleological; it
[is]{.underline} also [not consequentialist if by this is meant that to
maximize the good is the sole fundamental principle of right.
Incorporating rights or other moral dictates into the maximand is
incompatible with this very idea]{.underline}.4

[Deontology is the theory of moral obligation, and]{.underline}, by
connotation, [encompasses moral theories that emphasize rights and
duties]{.underline}. Put another way, deontological theories are those
moral theories of a vaguely Kantian stripe. Kant held that [one should

in \[one\'s\] own person or in the person of any other, never simply as
a means, but always at the same time as an end.\"]{.underline}22 It was
not always so. When Jeremy Bentham, one of utilitarianism\'s founders,
first coined the word in 1814, \"deontology\" referred to the marshaling
of self-interested reasons for agents to act for the general good.
Essentially, this was a utilitarian theory of obligation, and was quite
distinct from modern use. [Modern-day deontologists focus much attention
on rights]{.underline}.26 It might be thought that this focus is merely
a preference, for rights are often taken to be correlative with duties.
For example, where this relation holds, if I have a right not to be
punched, you are under an obligation not to punch me, and conversely.
Thus, deontology may be articulated through either related element. More
generally, in theories holding that rights and duties are correlative,
one may give an account of rights and then define duties by reference to
rights; one may define rights in terms of an antecedent theoretic
account of duties; or one may give separate theoretic accounts of rights
and duties.27 [Rights need not be completely correlative with
duties]{.underline}.28 For example, take the notion of privileges,
understood here as a subspecies of rights. The lone occupant of a small
and isolated island presumably possesses a privilege to sing show-tunes
at the top of her voice.2 This right, however, has no correlative
obligation. It is not just that the island, being otherwise deserted,
has no one in whom the obligation inheres. Rather, it is a structural
feature of the example that no obligation not to interfere can exist.
Introducing another person onto the island would destroy the privilege,
for it would be immoral for the singer to subject another person to her
showmanship without the other person\'s consent. Likewise, there may be
obligations for which correlative rights do not exist. For example, one
may be under an obligation to write letters to her grandfather without
her grandfather having the right to receive letters written by his
granddaughter.30 \"Omissions\" may also be understood as obligations for
which there are no corresponding rights. If you may easily save somebody
from great harm or death without substantial risk to yourself, a moral
obligation exists to so help them.3l Most people, however, do not think
that the victim has a right to your efforts.32 Although more could be
said, my point is that [whether or not one takes rights to be
correlative with duties has implications for other aspects of moral
theory.]{.underline} For the purposes of this Comment, there is no need
to trace the contours of deontology with precision. Thus, although it is
a simplification, this Comment will focus only on rights. The ultimate
goal, again, is to discover when [we may appeal to rights as a way of
protecting ourselves against the demands of society]{.underline}. The
next Part examines the nature of rights more closely.

Rights, for Dworkin, are understood functionally through their
distributional character, and are distinguished from goals.40 Take first
the distributional character of collective goals. These goals seek to
achieve some particular, even if vaguely defined, distribution within
the society.4\' For example, Dworkin notes that economic efficiency is
within a collective goal. Importantly, with respect to collective goals,
\"distributional principles are subordinate to some conception of
aggregate collective good, so that offering less of some benefit to one
\[person\] can be justified simply by showing that this will lead to a
greater benefit overall.\"43 Hence, the collective goals of a community
are appropriate fodder for consequentialist reasoning.
[Rights,]{.underline} however, [have a different distributional
character]{.underline}. As Dworkin states: \"[If someone has a right to
something, then it is wrong for the government to deny it to him even
though it would be in the general interest to do so.\"]{.underline}44
Put another way, [the right is prior to the good]{.underline}. Thus, for
Dworkin, \"individual rights are political trumps held by individuals".

[Reasonableness, or the capacity for a sense of justice, is the ability
to limit the pursuit of one's conception of the good out of a respect
for the rights and interests of other people and out of a desire to
cooperate with them on fair terms. A person who acts reasonably acts
according to a principle of reciprocity:]{.underline} he seeks to give
"justice to those who can give justice in return" (p. 447). The tight
connection between reasonableness and autonomy is explained by Rawls in
sec. 86 of *Theory*: "the sense of justice . . . reveals what the person
is, and to compromise it is not to achieve for the self free reign but
to give way to the contingencies and accidents of the world" (p. 503[).
When we act reasonably, says Rawls, we demonstrate an ability to
subordinate the pursuit of our own good, which may be unduly influenced
by the "contingencies and accidents of the world," to those principles
we would choose as members of the intelligible realm---our
reasonableness, in other words, is emblematic of our autonomy, our
independence from natural and social contingencies]{.underline}. [This
explains our sense of shame **when we *fail* to act reasonably: we
behave then as if we were members of a "lower order" of animal**, whose
actions are determined by the laws of nature rather than the moral
law]{.underline} (p. 225).

[The Priority of Right over the Good and the Priority of Justice over
Welfare and Efficiency are both expressions of our nature as
*reasonable* beings, i.e., beings able to act in conformity with, and
out of respect for, the moral law.]{.underline} In Kant's terms, to
sacrifice justice for the sake of welfare or excellence of character
would be to sacrifice what is of absolute value (the good will) for what
is of merely relative value (its complements). Rawls himself makes the
same strong connection between reasonableness and these two kinds of
priority: But [the desire to express our nature as a free and equal
rational being can be fulfilled only by *acting on the principles of
right and justice as having first priority*]{.underline}. . . .
[Therefore in order to realize our nature we have no alternative but to
plan to preserve our sense of justice as governing our other aims. This
sentiment cannot be fulfilled if it is compromised and balanced against
other ends as but one desire among the rest]{.underline} (TJ, p. 503,
emphasis added). Just as reasonableness is a key facet of our autonomy,
so the [priorities of right and justice are expressions of our
reasonableness: we best indicate our commitment to guide our actions by
the principles of justice by refusing to compromise those principles for
the sake of our other ends.]{.underline}

[Rationality is our capacity for a conception of the good, which we
pursue through a plan of life.]{.underline} We schedule, prioritize,
temper, and prune our desires in accordance with this plan[; rather than
living from impulse to impulse, as other animals do,]{.underline} [we
arrange the pursuit of our interests and ends according to a coherent
scheme]{.underline} (secs. 63--64). Now, given what was said in the
previous subsection, [one may find it difficult to see the connection
between rationality, so defined, and autonomy: if our desires are
largely the product of natural and social contingencies, then how can
acting in accordance with a plan to advance them be an aspect of our
autonomy? In other words, if rationality is merely the "slave of the
passions," 11 and these passions are the result of such contingencies,
then how can rationality possibly express our nature as free and equal
beings?]{.underline} According to Rawls, however, rationality is much
more than a "slave of the passions." [The exercise of rationality
involves a clear *distancing* from one's immediate desires, as Rawls
indicates in the following passage: The aim of deliberation is to find
that plan which best organizes our activities and influences the
formation of our subsequent wants so that our aims and interests can be
fruitfully combined into one scheme of conduct**. Desires that tend to
interfere with other ends, or which undermine the capacity for other
activities, are weeded out;** whereas those that are enjoyable in
themselves and support other aims as well are encouraged.12 The image of
rationality here is active]{.underline}, not passive. Rather than being
haplessly driven on by the dominant desires, rationality exercises
authority over them: [rationality elevates some desires and lays low
others; it integrates retained desires into "one scheme of conduct"; and
it even shapes the development of future desires.]{.underline} Far from
being a slave of desire, rationality is its master. This conception of
rationality is consistent with at least one reading of Kant's idea of
practical reason as applied to the pursuit of happiness: H. J. Paton
notes that prudential [reasoning in Kant's moral theory involves "a
choice of ends as well as means" and a subsequent "maximum integration
of ends."13]{.underline}

HJ. Utilitarianism and Natural Human Moral Rights. Pg 133.

The theory of *prima facie* human rights that is outlined here is one in
terms of *prima facie* rights, many of which are rights of recipience,
in which the [rights create obligations and claims that collide with one
another and with the moral demands created by other values. Many of
these conflicts are to be resolved without reference]{.underline}, or
with only negative reference, [to consequences. When the consequences do
enter seriously into the resolution of the conflicts, the solution
arrived at is often very different from that which would be dictated by
utilitarian considerations.]{.underline} The points made in the
preceding section may be illustrated by reference to conflicts of *prima
facie* human rights such as the right to life, viewed as a right of
recipience, the right to moral autonomy and integrity- and values such
as pleasure and happiness, and the absence of pain and suffering. [A
consideration of the morally rightful resolution of such conflicts
brings out the inadequacy of the utilitarian calculus as a basis for
determining the morally right response to such situations and
conflicts.]{.underline}

How can we absorb this idea into the conceptual scheme developed so far?
[Morality, as I have described it, is a feature of agents - their
motives, dispositions to fed guilt - and of the attitudes of the
generality of other persons toward agents - approval or disapproval of
them. In my account nothing has been said about the patients, the
targets of the behavior of agents.]{.underline} I now suggest that we
should extend our description of moral codes, to include something about
patients. First. [patients may have a disposition to resent
infringements of the rules we have been talking about when these impinge
on them, when they are the parties injured. or deprived. or
threatened.]{.underline} Of course, people tend to resent any deliberate
injury . so this reaction is not specific to rules of rights.10 Second,
persons who resent it when they are injured or deprived in one of these
ways or even when they are threatened because of the nonexistence of
institutions able to protect them, may also be inclined not to feel
ashamed or embarrassed to protest on their own behalf. This feature need
not occur, and in societies in which individuals have felt it is their
place to be downtrodden, ill-treated, and so on, it was not the case. Of
course there are several levels of this. [The first is expression of
resentment to the injuring party. A second level is public protest, or
joining in a public protest, calling attention to the situation and
inviting sympathy and support, particularly for the institution of legal
devices for prevention of what has occurred or redress or punishment
when it already has occurred. A third level is that of passive
disobedience, lack of cooperation, perhaps nonviolent economic pressure
that causes inconvenience or discomfort on behalf of a cause. Finally
there is violent action, willingness to cause personal or **property
damage, in order to bring about a change in those who are infringing
moral obligations** or to bring about legal institutions to prevent or
punish such infringements. Presumably the level of protest will normally
correlate with the strength of the obligation being infringed and the
seriousness of the damage or threat.]{.underline} The practice of
company stores might elicit one level of protest, the practice of lynch
law on members of a racial minority quite another.

[This is why we propose to maintain the concept of the act developed by
Kant, and to link it to the thematic of 'overstepping of boundaries,' of
'transgression', to the question of evil. It is a matter of
acknowledging the fact that any (ethical) act precisely in so far as it
is an act, is necessarily 'evil'. We must specify, however, what is
meant here by 'evil'. This is the evil that belongs to the very
structure of the act, to the fact that the latter always implies a
'transgression', a change in 'what is'. It is not a matter of some
'empirical' evil, it is the very logic of the act which is denounced as
'radically evil' in every ideology. The fundamental ideological gesture
consists in providing an image for this structural 'evil'. The gap
opened by an act (i.e. the unfamiliar, 'out-of-place' effect of an act)
is immediately linked in this ideological gesture to an *image*. As a
rule this is an image of suffering, which is then displayed to the
public alongside this question: *Is this what you want*? And this
question already implies the answer: *It would be impossible, inhuman,
for you to want this!* Here we have to insist on theoretical rigour, and
separate this (usually fascinating) image exhibited by ideology from the
source of uneasiness -- from the 'evil' which is not an 'undesired',
'secondary' effect of the good but belongs, on the contrary, to its
essence. We could even say that the ethical ideology struggles against
'evil' because this ideology is hostile to the 'good', to the logic of
the act as such. We could go even further here: the current saturation
of the social field by 'ethical dilemmas' (bioethics, environmental
ethics, cultural ethics, medical ethics...) is strictly correlative to
the 'repression' of ethics, that is, to an incapacity to think ethics in
its dimension of the Real, an incapacity to conceive of ethics other
than simply as a set of restrictions to yet another aspect of 'modern
society': to the 'depression' which seems to have became the 'social
illness' of our time and to set the tone of the resigned attitude of the
'(post)modern man' of the 'end of history'. In relation to this, it
would be interesting to reaffirm Lacan's thesis according to which
depression 'isn't a state of the soul, it is simply a moral failing, as
Dante, and even Spinoza, said: a sin, which means a moral weakness'. It
is against this moral weakness or cowardice \[*lachete morale*\] that we
must affirm the ethical dimension proper.]{.underline}

[The first difficulty with this concept of diabolical evil lies in its
very definition: that diabolical evil would occur if we elevated
opposition to the moral law to the level of a maxim (a principle or
law). What is wrong with this definition? Given the Kantian concept of
the moral law -- which is not a law that says 'do this' or 'do that',
but an enigmatic law which only commands us to do our duty, without ever
naming it -- the following objection arises: if the opposition to the
moral law were elevated to a maxim or principle, it would no longer be
an opposition to the moral law, it would be the moral law itself. At
this level no opposition is possible. It is not possible to oppose
oneself to the moral law at the level of the (moral) law. Nothing can
oppose itself to the moral law *on principle* -- that is, for
non-pathological reasons -- without itself becoming a moral law. To act
without allowing pathological incentives to influence our actions is to
do good. In relation to this definition of the good, (diabolical) evil
would then have to be defined as follows: it is evil to oppose oneself,
without allowing pathological incentives to influence one's actions, to
actions which do not allow any pathological incentives to influence
one's actions. And this is simply absurd.]{.underline}

Kant's second break with the tradition, related to the first, was his
rejection of the view that ethics is concerned with the 'distribution of
the good' (the 'service of goods' in Lacan's terms). Kant rejected an
ethics based on 'my wanting what is good for others, provided of course
that their good reflects my own'.

It is true that Lacan's position concerning the status of the ethics of
desire continued to develop. Hence his position in *Seminar XI (The Four
Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis)* differs on several points from
the one he adopted in *Seminar VII (The Ethics of Psychoanalysis).* That
'the moral law, looked at more closely, is simply desire in its pure
state' is a judgment which, had it been pronounced in *Seminar VII*,
would have had the value of a compliment; clearly this is no longer the
case when it is pronounced in *Seminar XI*. Yet even though the later
Lacan claims that 'the analyst's desire is not a pure desire', this does
not mean that the analyst's desire is pathological (in the Kantian sense
of the word), nor that the question of desire has lost its pertinence.
To put the matter simply, the question of desire does not so much lose
its central place as cease to be considered the endpoint of analysis. In
the later view analysis ends in another dimension, that of the drive.
Hence -- as the concluding remarks of *Seminar XI* have it -- before
this dimension opens up to the subject, he must first reach and then
traverse 'the limit within which, as desire, he is bound'.

Kant is admired by Lacan above all for his break, at two crucial points,
with 'traditional' ethics. The first is his break with the morality that
spelled out obligations in terms of the possibility of fulfilling them.
According to Lacan, the crucial point here is that morality as such, as
Kant well knew, is a demand for the impossible: 'the impossibility in
which we recognize the topology of our desire'. By insisting on the fact
that the moral imperative is not concerned with what might or might not
be done, Kant discovered the essential dimension of ethics: the
dimension of desire, which circles around the real *qua* impossible.
This dimension was excluded from the purview of traditional ethics, and
could therefore appear to it only as an excess. So Kant's crucial first
step involves taking the very thing excluded from the traditional field
of ethics, and turning it into the only legitimate territory for ethics.
If critics often criticize Kant for demanding the impossible, Lacan
attributes an incontestable theoretical value to this Kantian demand.

The 'Freudian blow' to philosophical ethics can be summarized as
follows: what philosophy calls the moral law -- and, more precisely,
what Kant calls the categorical imperative -- is in fact nothing other
than the superego. This judgment provokes an 'effect of disenchantment'
that calls into question any attempt to base ethics on foundations other
than the 'pathological.' At the same time, it places 'ethics' at the
core of what Freud called das *Unbehagen in der Kultur.* the discontent
or malaise at the heart of civilization. In so far as it has its origins
in the constitution of the superego, ethics becomes nothing more than a
convenient tool for any ideology which may try to pass off its own
commandments as the truly authentic, spontaneous and 'honourable'
inclinations of the subject. This thesis, according to which the moral
law is nothing but the superego, calls, of course, for careful
examination, which I shall undertake in Chapter 7 below.

## It is impossible to determine whether an action is truly ethical or not {#it-is-impossible-to-determine-whether-an-action-is-truly-ethical-or-not .Tags}

(Alenka Zupancic, researcher, Institute of Philosophy in the Slovene

By spelling things out in this way we can see clearly that the ethical
is, in fact, essentially a supplement. Let us, then, begin with the
first level (the legal). The content of action (its 'matter'), as well
as the form this content, are exhausted in the notion of 'in conformity
with duty'. As long as I do my duty nothing remains to be said. The fact
that the act that fulfils my duty may have been done exclusively for the
sake of this duty would change nothing at level of analysis. Such an act
would be entirely indistinguishable from an act done simply in accord
with duty, since their results would be exactly the same. The
significance of acting (exclusively) for the sake of duty will be
visible only on the second level analysis, which we will simply call the
level form. Here we come across a form which is no longer the form of
anything, of some content of other, yet it is not so much an empty form
as form 'outside' content, a form that provides form only for itself. In
other words, we confronted here with a supply which at the same time
seems to be 'pure waste', something that serves absolutely no purpose.

## Ethics in terms of attempts to do something 'good' only re-entrenches the presence of the omnipresent evil {#ethics-in-terms-of-attempts-to-do-something-good-only-re-entrenches-the-presence-of-the-omnipresent-evil .Tags}

(Alenka Zupancic, researcher, Institute of Philosophy in the Slovene

The theme of 'radical evil' is currently something of a hot topic, and
Kant, as a 'theoretician of radical evil', is subject to very diverse
and sometimes contradictory readings. In his book, *L'Ethique* Alain
Badiou points out that the topic of radical evil has become a spectre
raised by 'ethical ideologists' every time a will to do something (good)
appears. Every 'positive' project is capable of being undermined in
advance on the grounds that it might bring about an even greater evil.
Ethics would thus be reduced to only one function: preventing evil, or
at least lessening it. It seems that such an ethics of 'the lesser evil'
is justified in its reference to Kant. The criticism of Kant according
to which he defined the criteria of the (ethical) act in such a way that
one can never satisfy them goes as far back as Hegel. From this point it
follows that all our actions are necessarily 'bad', and that one can
remain 'pure' only if one chooses not to act at all. In this
perspective, good does not exist, whereas evil is 'omnipresent'.

[Chicago Journals]{.underline}) MF

Morality\'s purportedly threatening notion of \"obligation,\" for
ex-ample, is constructed by Williams entirely from the works of Kant and
Ross, with no gesture at showing what relation their philosophically
refined notions of \"obligation\" bear to those in play in ordinary
life. Yet where is the evidence, one might ask, that real [**people
treat** \"**moral obligations\] \[as\] inescapable\" (ELP, p. 177) and
that they accept the idea that \"only an obligation can beat an
obligation\"**]{.underline} (ELP, p. 180)**? [Surely the evidence is not
in the way people actually live, in the way they actually honor-or, more
often, breach-their moral obligations, a point Nietzsche well
understood.\'7 What is the evidence that, in our relativistic culture,
individuals think that \"moral obligation applies to people even if they
do not want it]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}**\" (ELP, p. 178)? Even
Williams, in leading up to the specter of morality dominating life, says
that \"the thought can gain a footing (I am not saying that it has to)
that I could be better employed than in doing something I am under no
\[moral\] obligation to do, and, if I could be, then I ought to be\"
(ELP, p. 181, emphasis added). But surely this \"thought\" might only
gain a footing for Kant or Ross, or some other philosopher who followed
out to its logical conclusion a deontological theory. [**It is a pure
philosopher\'s fantasy to think that real people in the moral culture at
large find themselves overwhelmed by this burdensome sense of moral
obliga- tion**.]{.underline} Like the other Morality Critics, Williams
writes as though he is attacking \"morality,\" when what he is really
attacking is \"morality\" as conceived, systematized, and refined by
philosophers. Such a critique may be a worthy endeavor, but it is far
different from worrying about the \"dangers\" of ordinary morality as
understood-unsystematically and inchoately-by ordinary people. What,
then, distinguishes a Morality Critic from a Theory Critic if both are
ultimately talking about moral theory? Roughly, the idea is this: for
the former, there is always room, in principle, for a better theory to
thwart the criticsm, while for the latter, **[Theory (in the technical
sense) is the heart of the problem, not part of the
solution.]{.underline}** These points are well illustrated in Stocker\'s
well-known paper \"The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories.\"\'8
Stocker argues that \"**[if we \... embody in our motives, those various
things which recent ethical theories hold to be ultimately good or
right, we will, of necessity, be unable to have those motives\"
(]{.underline}**p. 461) **[and thus be unable to realize the associated
goods]{.underline}** (e.g., friendship, love, pleasure). Stocker claims,
however, that a suitable ethical theory must be one in which reasons and
motives can be brought into harmony, such that one can be moved to act
by what the theory identifies as \"good\" or \"right.\" Stocker\'s point
isn\'t, then, that theorizing in ethics is a misguided enterprise; it\'s
just that we need better theories, ones in which theoretical reasons can
also serve as motives for action. Like a Morality Critic, Stocker holds
that adherence to morality as it is (read: moral theory as it is) is
incom-patible with having the motives requisite for certain personal
goods (\"love, friendship, affection, fellow feeling, and community,\"
p. 461); unlike a Theory Critic, he allows, or at least implies, that a
better (i.e., nonschizophrenic) theory could solve the problem.\'9

In this section, I will delineate Nietzsche's own brand of virtue
ethics. It should be clear that **[Nietzsche does indeed share the
critical program of virtue ethicists. His attacks against the
traditional view of morality and the nihilism he proposes make clear
that, for him, traditional morality is alienating to any human
life]{.underline}**. In *The Gay Science* he says: "In the main all
those moral systems are distasteful to me which say: 'Do not do this!
Renounce! Overcome thyself!'On the other hand I am favorable to those
moral systems which stimulate me to do something, and to do it again
from morning till evening, to dream of it at night, and think of nothing
else but to do it *well*, as well as is possible for *me* alone! \[. .
.\] I do not like any of the negative virtues whose very essence is
negation and self-renunciation" (§304). Elsewhere, in Twilight of the
Idols, [he **talks about a sin of morality: "The most general formula at
the basis of every religion and morality is: 'Do this and this---and you
will be happy! Otherwise. . . .' Every morality, every religion *is
this* imperative---I call it the great original sin of reason, *immortal
unreason*"**]{.underline} ("Errors" 2). Nietzsche's view of traditional
morality can be found throughout his writings; however, I think these
quotations are satisfactory for our purpose. These two clarify the
spirit with which Nietzsche approaches morality. **[The problem with
traditional morality is that it does not take into consideration human
nature. It does not look at the individual as he is and aim to embrace
what he is but, rather, aims to impose a model on him that has no ground
in the reality of the human. This model is of a transcendent nature and
does not fit the immanent nature of the human being.]{.underline}**

"One should own up in all strictness what is still necessary here for a
long time to come, what alone is justified so far: to collect material,
to conceptualize and arrange a vast realm of subtle feelings of value
and differences of value which are alive, grow, beget, and perish - and
perhaps attempts to present vividly some of the more frequent and
recur­ring forms of such living crystallizations - all to prepare a
*typology* of morals. To be sure: so far one has not been so modest.
With a stiff seriousness that inspires laughter, **[all]{.underline}**
our **[philosophers demanded something far more exalted, presumptuous,
and solemn from themselves as soon as they approached the study of
morality: they wanted to supply a *rational foundation* for morals; and
every philosopher so far has believed that he has provided such a
foundation. Moral­ity itself, however, was accepted as \"given.\" How
remote from their coarse pride was that task which they considered
insignificant and left in dust and dirt]{.underline}** - the task of
description, although the subtlest fingers and senses can scarcely be
sub­tle enough for it. **[Because our moral philosophers knew the facts
of morality only very approximately in arbitrary ex­tracts or in
accidental epitomes -]{.underline}** for example, as the morality of
their environment, their class, their church, their time, their climate
and part of the world - because they were poorly informed and not even
very curious about different peoples, ages, and the past, they never
laid eyes on the real problems of morality; for **[these emerge only
when we com­pare *many* moralities. In all previous studies of morality
one thing was lacking, strange as that may sound: the prob­lem of
morality itself;]{.underline}** what was lacking was the suspicion that
there was anything at all problematic here. What the philosophers called
\"a rational foundation for morality\" and tried to supply was, properly
considered, only a scholarly variation of a common *faith* in the
prevalent morality; a new means of *expression* of this faith; in short,
itself simply another feature of, or rather another fact within, a
particular morality; indeed, in the last analysis, a kind of denial that
this morality might ever be considered problematic -- certainly the very
opposite of an examination, analysis, questioning, and vivisection of
this very faith."

Nietzsche revolutionized ethics by asking new questions. As he saw it,
his predecessors had simply taken for granted that they knew what was
good and what was evil. Moral judgments had been accepted as
incontrovertible facts, and the philosophers had considered it their
task to find reasons for them. In other words, **[traditional moral
philosophers made it their business to rationalize the moral
idiosyncrasies of their environment.]{.underline}** What F. H. Bradley
was to say of metaphysics in his Preface to *Appearance and Reality*
(1891) is what Nietz­sche said in effect of traditional ethics: it is
\"the finding of bad reasons for what we believe on instinct.\'\" But
Nietzsche would not have added like Bradley that \"to find these reasons
is no less an instinct.\'\" Nor, indeed, did he consider moral
idiosyncrasies instinctive in any literal sense. Far from con­struing
them as part of our biological make-up, Nietzsche was struck by the
great variety of moral views in different times and places.To cite
Nietzsche\'s *Zarathustra* (\"On Old and New Tab­lets,\"
*§2**[):]{.underline}*** **[\"When I came *to* men I found them sitting
on an old conceit: the conceit that they have long known what is good
and evil for man. All talk of virtue seemed an old and weary matter to
man; and whoever wanted to sleep well still talked of good and evil
before going to sleep.\" With Nietzsche, our common moral valuations are
suddenly considered questionable, and ethics, instead of being a matter
of inconsequen­tial rationalizations, becomes a critique of culture, a
vivisection of modem man.]{.underline}**

[There is a]{.underline} common [criticism of absolutism]{.underline}
[which]{.underline}, if sound, [could be taken to demonstrate its
irrationality. It is that the absolutist refuses to consider the details
of particular cases and insists instead on the automatic application of
a blanket rule]{.underline}; [he thus fails]{.underline}, it is said,
[to \'take each case on its merits\'.]{.underline} Now there may be
absolutist positions which are vulnerable to this kind of objection;
[for example]{.underline}, [the position that one is never justified in
taking a human life, whatever the circumstances]{.underline}. Someone
might reasonably object that [there are moral distinctions to be made
over which this view simply rides rough-shod.]{.underline} Someone may
kill a fellow human being in many different circumstances and for many
different reasons; for personal gain of some kind; [to put a loved one
out of his misery; in self-defence; in just war or
revolution]{.underline}; as retribution; [and so on]{.underline}. Surely
[it would be irrational]{.underline}, if not absurd, to insist on
[making the same moral judgment about all these cases]{.underline}.
However, even if this is correct, it is a count against only some
absolutist positions, not against all. It is commonly assumed that the
absolutist must operate with some highly general, exceptionless rules;
but this is not an accurate picture of the kind of absolutism of which I
have been speaking throughout this paper. I have spoken, not so much of
moral rules, but of specific moral notions, concepts, or
categories-murder, courage, cowardice, honesty, loyalty, etc.; and I
have maintained that these operate as fundamental in moral assessment,
in the sense that their applicability to a particular action will often
be morally decisive, and, for some of them, will always be so.14 Let us
consider the example of murder, which is a notion the applicability of
which to an action is always morally decisive. My absolutist claims, not
that killing can never be justified, but that murder can never be
justified; and he will not classify all cases of killing as cases of
murder. Thus [it is simply not true that he does not have to investigate
the details of a particular case; indeed it is only through such an
investigation that he can be in a position to decide whether or not the
action in question is properly classifiable as \'murder\']{.underline}.
Further-more, [he will take into account many features of the situation
not con-sidered relevant by the consequentialist,]{.underline} for
example, [the agent\'s motive for the killing.]{.underline} Indeed, [it
could be maintained that the consequentialist\'s claim to consider each
case \'on its merits\' is vitiated by his extremely restricted
conception of where these merits must lie. I maintain that it is he,
with his exclusive concentration upon consequences, who abstracts from
morally relevant features of particular cases]{.underline}. Again, this
is a point to which I will return. Thus, if readiness to pay attention
to the details of individual cases be a test of rationality, my
absolutist passes it with his colours flying rather more conspicuously
than those of the supporters of consequentialism; they, after all, have
theformula.

We might say that the ethical dimension of an action is 'supernumerary'
to the conceptual pair legal/illegal. This in turn suggests a structural
connection with the Lacanian notion of the Real. As Alain Badiou has
noticed, Lacan conceives of the Real in a way that removes it from the
logic of the apparently mutually exclusive alternatives of the knowable
and the unknowable. The unknowable is just a type of the knowable; it is
the limit or degenerate case of the knowable; where the Real belongs to
another register entirely. Analogously, for Kant the illegal still falls
within the category of legality -- they both belong to the same
register, that of things conforming or failing to conform with duty.
Ethics -- to continue the analogy -- escapes this register. Even though
an ethical act will conform with duty, this by itself is not and cannot
be what makes it ethical. So the ethical cannot be situated within the
framework of the law and violations of the law. Again, in relation to
legality, the ethical always presents a surplus or excess.

## Ethical action and legality cannot be related {#ethical-action-and-legality-cannot-be-related .Tags}

**Zupancic, researcher, Institute of Philosophy in the Slovene Academy

(Alenka Zupancic, researcher, Institute of Philosophy in the Slovene
Academy of Sciences, 2000, [Ethics of the Real]{.underline}, p. 14-16)

But then, what exactly is 'at stake', what is this pure form? First of
all, it is clear that the form in question cannot be 'the form of the
matter', simply because Kant situates the legal and the ethical in two
different registers. Hence matter and form, the legal and the ethical,
are not two different aspects of one and the same thing. Despite this,
several commentators have suggested the following solution to the
Kantian problem of form: every form has a content associated with it; we
are always and only dealing with a form and a content. So, in this view,
if we are to decide whether an act is ethical or not, we simply have to
know which in fact determines our will: if it is the form, our actions
are pathological; if it is the form, they are ethical. This indeed,
would rightly be called formalism -- but it not what Kant is aiming at
this his use of the concept of 'pure form'. First of all we should
immediately note that the label 'formalism' is more appropriate for what
Kant calls legality. In terms of legality, all that matters is whether
or not an action conform with duty -- the 'content' of such an action,
the real motivated for this conformity, is ignored; it simply does not
matter. But the ethical, unlike the legal, does in fact present a
certain claim concerning the 'content' of the will. Ethics demands not
only that an action conform with duty, but also that this conformity be
the only 'content' or 'motive' of that action. Thus Kant's emphasis on
form is in an attempt to disclose a possible drive for ethical action.
Kant is saying that 'form' has to come to occupy the position formerly
occupied by 'matter', that form itself has to function as a drive. Form
itself must be appropriated as a material surplus, in order for it to be
capable of the will. Kant's point, I repeat, is not that all traces
materiality have to be purged from the determining ground of the moral
will but, rather, that the form of the moral law has itself become
'material', in order for it to function as a motive force of action. As
result of this we can see that there are actually two different problems
to be resolved, 'mysteries' to be cleared up, concerning the possibility
of a 'pure' ethical act. The first is the one we commonly associate with
Kantian ethics. How is it possible to reduce or eliminate all the
pathological motives or incentives of our actions? How can a subject
disregard all self-interest, ignore the 'pleasure principle', all
concerns with her own well-being and the well-being of those close to
her? What kind of a monstrous, 'inhuman' subject does Kantian ethics
presuppose? This line of questioning is related to the issue of the
'infinite purification' of the subject's will, with its logic of 'no
matter how far you have come *one more effort* will always be required'.
The second question that must be dealt with concerns what we might call
the 'ethical transubstantiation' required by Kant's view: the question
of the possibility of converting a mere form into a materially
efficacious drive. This second question is, in my view, the more
pressing of the two, because answering it would automatically provide an
answer to the first question as well. So -- how can something which is
not in itself pathological (i.e. which has nothing to do with the
representation of pleasure or pain, the 'usual' mode of subject's
casuality) nevertheless become the cause or drive of a subject's
actions? The question here is no longer that of a 'purification' of
motives and incentives. It is much more radical: how can 'form' become
'matter', how can something which, in the subject's universe, does not
qualify as a cause, suddenly become a cause? This is the real 'miracle'
involved in ethics. The crucial question of Kantian ethics is thus not
'how can we eliminate all the pathological elements of will, so that
only the pure form of duty remains?' but rather, 'how can the pure form
of duty itself function as a pathological element, that is, as an
element capable of assuming the role of the driving force or incentive
of our actions?'. If the latter were actually to take place -- if the
'pure form of duty' were actually to operate as a motive (incentive or
drive) for the subject -- we would no longer need to worry about the
problems of the 'purification of the will' and the elimination of all
pathological motives.This, however, seems to suggest that for such a
subject, ethics simply becomes 'second nature', and thus ceases to be
ethics altogether. If acting ethically is a matter of drive, if it is as
effortless as that, if neither sacrifice, suffering, nor renunciation is
required, then it also seems utterly lacking in merit and devoid of
virtue. This, in fact, was Kant's contention: he called such a condition
the 'holiness of the will', which he also thought was an unattainable
ideal for human agent. It could equally be identified with utter
banality -- 'the banality of the radical good to paraphrase Hannah
Arendt's famous expression. Nevertheless -- and it is one of the
fundamental aims of this study to show this -- this analysis moves too
quickly, and therefore leaves something out. Our theoretical premiss
here is that it will actually be possible to found an ethics on the
concept of the drive, without this ethics collapsing into either the
holiness or banality of human actions.

Diprose 08

**(***Philosophy Social Criticism* 2008; 34; 617 Rosalyn Diprose,
**Arendt and Nietzsche on responsibility and futurity**
http://psc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/6/617)

The final point I want to highlight about Arendt's account of
responsibility is this: she asks the burning question, what provides the
criterion of judgment if not moral norms one has inherited or explicit
laws that may have been reversed by those who govern the public sphere?
On the basis of the idea that judgment is a reflective self-relation in
the form of a dialogue with oneself, Arendt argues that the criterion
that limits what one permits oneself to do is set by what would allow
one to live at 'peace with oneself' (SQMP 108). Following Socrates,
conscience, she argues, is governed by the desire to avoid
self-contradiction or, following Kant, the desire to avoid
self-contempt.13 Put simply 'it is better to suffer wrong than do wrong'
(a dictum that she claims, while originating with Socrates, underlies
all moral philosophy) because you could not, logically and with dignity,
live with that other part of yourself that you would kill or make
suffer. As a lover of contradiction Nietzsche would not hold to this
idea that making peace with oneself either inspires or provides the
criteria for conscience. While I think he is right about that, I am not
convinced that he succeeds in coming up with appropriate alternative
criteria. That is what I will attempt to do. What is radical about
**[Nietzsche's approach to responsibility]{.underline}**, and what will
be my focus in the next section, is that he locates the condition of
conscience, normativity and responsibility, not first of all in
reflective thinking or judgment, but in *responsiveness* based on what I
will call *somatic reflexivity*. For him, **[what opens that gap between
past and future is the constitution of a corporeal and affective
self-relation that manifests as a futural ability to respond to
circumstances with conscience and in excess of existing law and custom.
This is an important intervention into the meaning of being-responsible,
for several reasons. First, it moves the debate about responsibility
beyond the impasse between freedom and determinism by proposing that the
relation between the self and the juridico-moral code is constitutive
(and therefore habitual), but, as with Arendt, it must also be
excessive, self-critical and potentially transformative of
norms]{.underline}**. Second, in a departure from Arendt, **[Nietzsche's
idea that this constitutive and transformative relation involves
feeling, or the channeling of affect into action and
thought]{.underline}**, is crucial I think for **[explaining how
political ideals of national identity that effect a reversal of moral
norms in the public realm can have such a rapid and potentially
destructive impact on a population]{.underline}**. Third, in placing the
highest value in the uniqueness and opacity of this somatic reflexivity,
rather than in, say, 'life itself'14 or human 'dignity' based on
autonomous practical reason, Nietzsche revises the very basis of
normativity in ethics and politics: this somatic reflexivity is that
through and for which we are, most fundamentally, responsible whatever
the other characteristics (sex, race, religion, age) that corporeality
may signify. This responsiveness and, hence, responsibility, as Emmanuel
Levinas later puts it, is 'what first enables one to catch sight of and
conceive of value'.15 Fourth, Nietzsche's emphasis on the temporal
dimension of somatic reflexivity reveals what is most at stake in a
crisis of morality in politics. It is the *body open to* *an
undetermined future* that is a condition of agency, normativity and
responsibility and it is this futural inclination or futurity of the
body that is most at risk in such a crisis. Where Arendt improves on
Nietzsche is through implying another criteria of judgment besides the
criterion she highlights, the supposed desire to avoid
self-contradiction. This other criterion of judgment that would limit
what we can do in good conscience is implied in her work on political
community where it becomes apparent that we are not only responsible
through our own futurity, we are also responsible for maintaining the
world for the disclosure of the 'who' and hence the futurity of others.
And this is where morality meets politics. The political concern is not
whether the act of striking somebody unjustly or being struck is more
disgraceful. The concern is exclusively with having a world in which
such acts do not occur. (SQMP 93) Ordinarily, **[morality, understood as
fixed principles for guiding action that vary between individuals and
groups, along with individual thought itself, have no place in politics,
as politics is concerned with *collective* dialogue and action and the
maintenance of law regarded as 'essential to the integrity of our common
humanity']{.underline}** (PRD 22). While one may concede that compromise
lies at the heart of the political, there is a conceptual difficulty
with the way Arendt always insists that thinking is individual, is
distinct from and runs counter to the collective speech and action that
characterizes the political.16 This is why she describes the moral I
have been discussing as a 'borderline phenomenon': moral judgment is
only relevant to politics in times of crisis, that is, when customary
moral standards, which would ordinarily guide action without thinking,
have been suspended or reversed in the public realm (SQMP 104--5). It is
also why she needs to posit judgment of particulars, experienced as
conscience, as the bridge and arbiter between thinking and morality, on
the one hand, and politics and law on the other. **[Morality and law
intersect, for example, insofar as they 'deal with persons' rather than
institutions and systems]{.underline}** (SQMP 57) **[and they presuppose
the same 'power of judgment' of what is right and wrong]{.underline}**
(PRD 22). **[I suggest that morality is a borderline political issue
also in the sense that when political initiatives of government
precipitate a conflict then dampening of conscience within a citizenry
what this exposes is that these initiatives have undermined, not just
customary moral standards, but with that the basis of *normativity* that
both liberal democratic politics and morality would ordinarily share,
whatever particular moral values one holds]{.underline}**. Taking into
account the corporeal and affective basis of conscience, **[I will argue
that the basis of normativity in both politics and morality in a secular
democracy is not only the preservation of human 'dignity']{.underline}**
understood as the capacity for judgment in Arendt's sense but, more
fundamentally, and as a precondition of judgment, maintenance of the
*collective exposure to each other of the uniqueness of the futurity of
bodies*. Government that puts this in jeopardy, by abandoning political
responsibility for maintaining the conditions for this, is no longer
anonymous in the Foucauldian sense -- it has separated itself from the
collectivity of the *polis* that it would then totalize.

I hope that this necessarily overbrief argument has served to lay down
the coordinates for a thinking together of Camus and Derrida. For both
authors, the possibility of an identity wholly insulated from \[the\]
Other\[s\] is debarred to us as finite. Indeed, a further parallel
between their works consists in how both consider the 'lure' of this
possibility profoundly *dangerous*. In *The Rebel*, **[Camus argued that
the crimes of the Holocaust (like those of the Gulag) represented not
outbreaks of chaos within the enlightened world, but the products of an
inhumanity ever close to the enlightenment's elevation of
reason]{.underline}**. *'*What a clean up!' **[Clamence likewise remarks
of the Nazis']{.underline}** 'spacing . . . out' of the Jewish quarters
of Amsterdam, where (significantly) Camus has him residing in *The
Fall*: **['Seventy-five thousand Jews deported or assassinated; that's
real vacuum cleaning. I admire that diligence, that methodical patience!
When one has no character one *has* to apply a method']{.underline}**
(1963: 10). **['Haven't you noticed that our society is organized for
this kind of liquidation?]{.underline}**' (ibid.: 8).Derrida's
comparative *Zeitdiagnose*, defended in such pieces as *'*The Principle
of Reason' (1983), is more widely known. Indeed, what I will argue gives
deconstruction its 'prophetic' tone is how Derrida like Camus always
argues that untainted Identity is not only impossible, but to be
*prohibited*. **[There is always a danger, Derrida argues, of a
'politics of the archive' that deconstruction resists and
decries]{.underline}** (cf. Caputo, 1997:265)**[. It is an
'ethic-politics' that gives body to the logo centric desire which he has
always argued organizes even the most apparently extra philosophical
praxes and institutions.]{.underline}** **[It has the form of the claim
that' "we" are the . . . uniquely chosen archive of the
Truth']{.underline}**, **[Caputo writes]{.underline}** in The Prayers
and Tears of Jacques Derrida: **[In that sense, the mal d'archive lies
at the basis of every feverish racism, nationalism, fundamentalism, or
messianism, at the root of every 'identitarianism'.Burning with the
desire to kill off, to incinerate, the memory and the trace of the
other, archive fever is not a finite, limited threat, no tone threat
among others. . . . Archive evil, mal d'archive, is the root of all
evil]{.underline}**. (Caputo, 1997: 265) The question then becomes
**[for both Camus and Derrida what viable alternative exists to such a
fevered 'ethic politics'. For the famed 'death of God' in modernity has
not quelled its 'radical evil', both agree. It has only given rise to
refigurations of this evil]{.underline}**.6 As Clamence again rejoins
towards the end of *The Fall*: He who clings to a law does not fear the
judgement that puts him in his place within an order he believes in. . .
. \[T\]he keenest of human torments is to be judged without law. Yet we
are in that torment \[today\]. Deprived of their natural curb, the
judges, loosed at random, are racing through their job. Hence we have to
try to go faster than they, don't we? And it's a real madhouse. Prophets
and quacks multiply: they hasten to get there with a good law or a
flawless organization before the world is deserted. (1963: 86--7) How
does Derrida respond to this 'madhouse'? In *Passions*, in fact, he
takes up the logic of responding *tout court*. The context is an
invitation he has received to speak on the occasion of the publication
of *Derrida: A Critical Reader*. How should he have taken up this
invitation? Derrida asks himself. To speak authoritatively, he notes,
would involve running the risk of claiming an exclusive patent over the
signifier **[*'*Derrida*'* and the texts which it names, as if he had
the right and the capability to assume such an authority. To 'not
respond', he notes, however, would be no less dangerous, since silence
is a mode of discourse which can humiliate others more violently than
anything said. As Caputo notes, then, here Derrida adduces a *moral*
*refiguring of the double bind*. *'*Either way', he says, Derrida '. . .
is sacrificed: this is a double bind in which his two hands are tied or
nailed down']{.underline}** (Caputo, 1997: 106).

Rosalyn **Diprose** 20**08**\
Arendt and Nietzsche on responsibility and futurity\
\
With regard to this overarching concern for the body's futurity,
Nietzsche has three related criticisms of juridical self-responsibility.
First, insofar **[as the constitution of the responsive self is
normalizing, with reference to a 'morality of mores and the social
straitjacket' that guides future action, any responsibility the
individual assumes for such action is not genuine]{.underline}** (GM II
2 and HAH 105**[): responsibility cannot rest on blind obedience to
ideals and norms that have been imposed rather than
chosen.]{.underline}** Second, and conversely, Nietzsche is critical of
the 'fable of responsibility' insofar as it rests on the illusion of
free will (HAH 39). Two aspects of his well-known critique of free will
are relevant here. One is that the illusion of free will carries with it
the illusion that we can choose and predict the future in advance (HAH
105). The other is Nietzsche's claim that the individual is not
responsible for anything arising from 'his nature' because 'his nature'
is not freely chosen; it is to some extent inherited -- it is 'an
outgrowth of the elements and influences of past and present things'
(HAH 39; see also GM I 13). While, for Nietzsche, we cannot choose the
future or our inheritance, we can, through somatic reflexivity,
transform our inheritance and so keep the future open. Nietzsche's third
criticism of juridical self-responsibility follows from the other two
and is the one I wish to emphasize: in pre-empting a future**[,
juridical self-responsibility dampens responsiveness and forecloses
futurity.22 Insofar as the 'last man', for example, is the embodiment of
a socially prescribed good, in him the future, ordained in advance, is
actualized. He is the endpoint of a teleological conception of history
where everything leads toward the realization of some ideal
identity.]{.underline}** But, if such an ideal could be realized, those
who embody it would be 'unable to *create*', unable to respond to
'elements and influences' of concrete existence in a way that keeps the
body open to the future and keeps affects and their interpretations open
to revaluation. **[Any set of ideas or 'legal order thought of as
sovereign and universal . . . would be a principle hostile to life, an
agent of the dissolution and destruction of man, an attempt to
assassinate the future of man']{.underline}** (GM II 11).23 The 'last
man' is the end of history, the end of spatio-temporalization, and so
would be as 'dyspeptic' as the self for whom the force of forgetting is
dysfunctional -- 'he cannot "have done" with anything' (GM I 1). **[He
would have the 'conscience' of a machine.]{.underline}**

When revisited **[in light of pressing contemporary topics and events
such as immigration, terrorism, the Internet and its censorship or
surveillance by the State]{.underline}** (police), civil wars, etc.,
these canonical texts **[reveal to Derrida the heterogeneous yet
irreducible relation between a genuine ethics of hospitality and a
politics of hospitality. Whereas absolute/unconditional/all-inclusive
hospitality suggests a \"law without imperative, without order and
without duty\"]{.underline}** (83), **[the laws of
ordinary/conditional/exclusive hospitality refer to the actual
conditions of hospitality, its rights and duties, which preexist the
subject and are inscribed in the social/political order]{.underline}**
(25). **[These political structures share a phallogocentric model that
Derrida traces back to the Greco-Roman and the Judeo-Christian
traditions. According to them, it is always a male figure of authority
that, in laying down the laws of hospitality, testifies to the
\"violence of the power of hospitality\"]{.underline}** (149).
**[Playing upon the]{.underline}** ambiguity of the French word
\"hôte\"\--which can mean both \"guest\" and \"enemy\"\--**[Derrida
reflects on the paradoxical status of the host at the moment of his/her
initial encounter with the *xenos*. This proximity between \"host\" and
\"hostage\" also accounts for the nexus between hospitality and
hostility, which Derrida turns to when he considers the false dualities
of private and public, private law and public law.
Derrida\'s]{.underline}** careful **[analysis of]{.underline}** the
**[political uses and abuses of]{.underline}** an ideal **[hospitality
leads him to suggest that political action should take place in the
space between ethics and politics.]{.underline}** Digressive and
informal, his discourse on hospitality is also rich in potentialities
due to the deconstructive method through which he uncovers the mystery
at the heart of the \"naturally obvious\" (136). In the sense that it
expands, or, to quote Dufourmantelle, \"takes to the limit\" the \"field
of the thinkable,\" the movement of Derrida\'s \"spoken reflecting\"
(10) is indeed \"hyperbolic,\" just as it constitutes an act of
remembrance, in that it \"revives questions held in forgetfulness and
secrecy\" (140). Thus both lectures deserve credit not only for
representing a significant step in Derrida\'s reflection on ethics and
politics but also for prompting us to begin our own deconstructive work
and rethink our identity.

In sum, **[the subject of modern ethics is a subject fundamentally
constituted through the maintenance of boundaries, both social and
spatial]{.underline}**. Partly for this reason, **[much modern ethical
thought has focused concern on those distant others who are located 'on
the other side of the boundary]{.underline}**'. Indeed, as Zygmunt
Bauman (1991: 59) has noted, within the modern spatialization of
subjectivity**[, the figure of the stranger becomes the prototypical
ethical problem, because 'the stranger is . . . someone who refuses to
remain confined to the "far away" land or go away from our own and hence
. . . defies the easy expedient of spatial or temporal
segregation]{.underline}**.' In a similar vein, Michael Dillon (1999)
has argued that [**the refugee, existing outside of ontopolitical
borders, has come to represent 'a scandal' for modern political
subjectivity, calling into question the nature of political and ethical
conduct. The typical response to such problems has been to endow the
autonomous subject with a set of rights, which can be legally enforced
within the boundaries of political jurisdiction**.]{.underline} One of
the most important figures in this conception of ethics is Kant, who
believed that the project of modernity could be universally extended for
the benefit of humankind through the application of reason and judgment
(Shapiro, 1998). Kant's philosophy, as Walker (1999: x) notes, was an
'attempt to internalize the law of reason, to develop the autonomous
rationality, the mature personality realizable within each individual so
that it might act in accordance with some universal moral norm'.
Importantly, Kant viewed this 'universal norm' arising from the spatial
interconnections between different parts of the world, which
necessitated a 'cosmopolitical right' that would guarantee conditions of
'universal hospitality'. Kant writes (1939: 27): \[due to\] the
connections, more or less near, which have taken place among the nations
of the earth, having been carried to that point, that a violation of
right, committed in one place, is felt throughout the whole, the idea of
a cosmopolitical right . . . is the last step of perfection necessary to
the tacit code of civil and public right. For Kant, this notion of a
'public right' was 'founded upon a federation of free states' (1939:
18), **[and thus depended upon a bounded notion of state citizenship.
These two notions -- the autonomous subject of political reason and the
territorialization of the state system -- have come to define
contemporary politics based upon an epistemology of
*sovereignty*]{.underline}**. Recent work in international relations
theory has posed significant challenges to this conception of
sovereignty, politics and space (Edkins *et al*., 1999; Campbell and
Shapiro, 1999b). **[Rather than accepting state territorialization and
citizenship as natural, such work suggests that we view it as part and
parcel of the philosophical infrastructure of modernity.]{.underline}**
As Shapiro notes (1999: 60), **[our understandings: tend to be
constructed within a statecentric, geostrategic cartography, which
organizes the interpretation of enmities on the basis of an individual
and collective national subject and cross-boundary antagonisms. Ethical
approaches aimed at a normative inhibition of these antagonisms continue
to presume this same geopolitical cartography.]{.underline}** One of the
provocations of poststructuralism would be to call into question this
conception of subjectivity and space, to follow Jean-Luc Nancy (2000:
136) in **[asserting that 'in order to think the *spacing* of the world
. . . the end of sovereignty must be faced head-on'. It is in this sense
that Whatmore (1997) has called for a 'dissecting of theautonomous self'
in order to promote a 'relational ethics']{.underline}** (see also
Cloke, 2002**[). We need, as David Slater (1997: 68) puts it, to
'rethink what we might mean by responsibility to otherness. This
responsibility can be linked to a notion of radical interdependence, in
which the ethics of intersubjectivity are in the
foreground.']{.underline}**

Although I am sympathetic with the impulse behind such sentiments, I
think that Smith mischaracterizes the nature of 'postmodern thinking',
and I would suggest that a deeper engagement might be possible between
the concerns of poststructuralism and geographical ethics. [**This
engagement would reject any normative ground for ethical conduct, not in
order to evade our responsibility to distant others, but rather because
foundational normative theories provide the means by which our ethical
responsibility can be elided**.]{.underline} From this perspective,
**[the deconstruction of universalist conceptions of rights, ethics and
justice should be viewed as a means of opening possibilities, rather
than closing them.]{.underline}** In what follows, I want to elaborate
on this perspective, focusing attention on three areas in particular:
the nature of the subject, the question of politics, and the ways in
which these imply particular understandings of space. Most renditions of
moral or ethical theory have their roots in Enlightenment thinking, when
the decentering of the authority of God and monarch placed human
individuals at the center of the social world, and thus provided the
possibility for an ethics that would be based upon human reason and
agency (Venn, 2000). The locus of this agency is the Cartesian subject,
endowed with autonomy and rationality, and thereby capable of making
moral decisions**.** There are two dimensions in particular of this
modern subjectivity that are worth highlighting here. First, **[the
modern subject's coherence and autonomy has been managed and maintained
through repeated attempts to define,]{.underline} [categorize and
classify a range of deviant 'others'. Modern notions of autonomy and
agency, in other words, have been dependent upon the specification and
control of difference]{.underline}** [(ethnic, racial, gender, class,
etc**.), against which the positive identity and self-image of the**
(western, male) Enlightenment **subject could be
maintained.**]{.underline} **[The birth of the modern subject, in this
sense, is tightly bound up with the processes of colonialism,
industrialization and governmentality through which certain kinds of
difference were made to matter in both conscious and, perhaps
especially, unconscious ways]{.underline}** (Pile, 1996; Wilton, 1998;
Venn, 2000). The second and related point is that the ways in which
these various axes of identity/difference have been mobilized are
fundamentally spatial. [**Modern subjectivity is not only inscribed
through a dualism between self and other, but also between here and
there, via the spatialization of inclusion and exclusion, presence and
absence, and the specification of what is 'in-place' and
'out-of-place'**]{.underline} (Shields, 1992; Sibley, 1995; Cresswell,
1996; Kirby, 1996). The Cartesian subject is interpellated within
ametaphysics of spatial presence -- in Heidegger 's terms, *Dasein*, or
being-*there* -- and circumscribed by a location or place from which it
can negotiate the world. Derrida (1994a: 82) has referred to this
metaphysics as *ontopology*, 'an axiomatics linking indissociably the
ontological value of present-being to its *situation*, to the stable and
presentable determination of a locality, the *topos* of territory,
native soil, city, body in general'.

**Arendt and Nietzsche on responsibility and futurity**
http://psc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/6/617)

First, in 'Some Questions of Moral Philosophy' and 'Responsibility Under
Dictatorship' (or what Arendt prefers to call 'totalitarianism'), and
crucially for a revision of the juridical sense of responsibility,
**[Arendt, following Nietzsche, argues that conscience, and hence the
capacity for personal or self-responsibility, is not determined either
by the moral norms we inherit or by the particular laws of the society
into which we are born. Otherwise how could such norms be so easily
reversed and the reversal embraced by a majority of a citizenry, and,
further, as Nietzsche would say, how can we be responsible for acts
determined by conventions we did not choose]{.underline}**? Arne
Vetlesen shows, in his comprehensive analysis of Arendt's thoughts on
the relation **[between conscience and doing evil, that she actually
points to two kinds of conscience: that ever present conscience that
operates habitually and is influenced by prevailing norms and
laws]{.underline}** (TMC 186), **[and conscience that, as the
'experience' of judgment of 'particulars']{.underline}** (TMC 189)
**[that is a 'by-product of thinking', makes thinking 'manifest in the
world']{.underline}** (LM I 193)**[, where the thinking that conscience
makes manifest is not knowledge of the 'good' but the challenging of all
established criteria, values and 'accepted rules of
conduct']{.underline}** (TMC 188).8 This second kind of conscience is
what matters to Arendt. Put simply, both she and **[Nietzsche posit a
difference between acting habitually in accordance with moral and legal
rules that dictate what is right and wrong and what Nietzsche would call
'genuine' conscience -- the experience of the capacity to judge what is
right or wrong *for oneself*]{.underline}**. Second, in linking
conscience to reflective critical thought or judgment**[,]{.underline}**
Arendt posits a connection between the experience of conscience and both
the undeterminable and futural character of the self. That is,
reflective thinking (hence judgment of particulars experienced as
conscience), and along with it our finitude, temporalize the self in a
way necessary for both responsibility and an undetermined future.
Arendt's account of the historicity of the self borrows from Nietzsche's
concept of time in *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, 'The Vision and the
Riddle'.9 Against both cyclic and linear notions of time, Zarathustra
formulates time in terms of two paths extending from the present gateway
called the 'moment' in which human beings stand, one toward the past and
the other toward a future that contradicts the past. In *Life of the
Mind* (especially LM I 202--13) Arendt argues that it is the act of
reflective thought that opens this gap between past and future to
disrupt the passive passing of linear historical time between those two
exemplars of human finitude: the moments of birth and death.10 **[Only a
finite being can inherit a tradition of laws and moral norms, but in
inheriting a tradition that would determine the path one takes, the act
of reflection, that is, remembrance and anticipation, opens an
undetermined future]{.underline}**. Nietzsche's gateway, for Arendt, is
'. . . \[t\]he path paved by thinking \[or judgment\] . . . within the
space-time given to natal and mortal men. Following that course, the
thought-trains, remembrance and anticipation, save whatever they touch
from the ruin of historical and biographical time. This small non-time
space in the very heart of time, unlike the world and the culture into
which we are born, cannot be inherited and handed down by tradition'.
(LM I 210) **[This gap between the past (tradition memorialized) and an
undetermined future, which thinking opens and conscience makes manifest,
constitutes the self's futurity. And it is this futurity that is
foreclosed in a dampening of conscience and a failure of personal
responsibility]{.underline}**. **[Not only do 'totalitarian' government
and a reversal of norms for the treatment of others jeopardize this
fundamental undetermined futural aspect of the human condition, but it
also destroys human plurality in general.]{.underline}**11 Arendt's
third salient point then is that the capacity for judgment (and
therefore conscience) expresses what she had referred to in *The Human
Condition* as the 'who' as opposed to the 'what' of the person (HC 179).
Her model of judgment in her reflections on responsibility is explicitly
Kantian, although it owes much to Socrates. Conscience is at once the
capacity to judge particulars autonomously and rationally *and* it is a
self-relation, that is, it is self-awareness and an internal dialogue
with oneself (e.g. SQMP 76; see also LM I 179--93). As an internal
dialogue between the habitual self and the self's other internal
witness, judgment expresses both 'difference in identity' (TMC 183--4)
and the person's capacity to transform the past and embark on a new
path: judgment or thinking expresses the person in his or her
uniqueness, and conscience is the experience of this uniqueness made
manifest in the world. The process of thinking, as opposed to knowing,
therefore indicates that humans 'exist in the plural' (SQMP 96) and
'thinking and remembering . . . is the human way of striking roots, of
taking one's place in the world into which we all arrive as strangers.
What we usually call a person . . . as distinguished from a mere human
being or nobody, actually grows out of this root-striking process of
thinking' (SQMP 100). So, although Arendt does not put it this way, this
capacity to discourse with oneself, including the judgment of what is
right and wrong, is, for her, the basis of normativity in two senses: it
is the capacity through which we arrive at our own norms of conduct and,
as a capacity in others, it is what gives other persons moral value.
**[Acting according to conscience, being responsible in a non-juridical
sense, rather than being coordinated by a totalizing politics, is, she
says, how one can regain what those in 'former times', including Kant,
'called the dignity or the honor of man: not perhaps of mankind but of
the status of being human' (]{.underline}**PRD 48).

**Arendt and Nietzsche on responsibility and futurity**
http://psc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/6/617)

**[The juridical concept of self-responsibility cannot explain, and
indeed may exacerbate, a contemporary crisis of conscience of the order
that concerned Arendt: when liberal democratic governments initiate
programs that citizens feel are contrary to what they had assumed
(rightly or wrongly) to be law or moral custom]{.underline}**.4 Examples
of this abound in the present: a government engages in what its citizens
consider to be an unjustified war or it annexes part of its territory
for what its citizens may consider to be immoral and illegal treatment
of refugees (in the case of Australia) or prisoners of war (e.g.
Guantanamo Bay in the case of the USA). Or, as happened in Australia in
December 2005, a government implements (anti-terrorism) legislation that
puts in jeopardy fundamental rights and freedoms of its own citizens
(for example, provisions allowing preventative detention without charge
and control of the movement of individuals or groups merely suspected of
terrorist activities, and antisedition provisions that criminalize
activities that urge disaffection against the government).5 Or less
dramatic but of a similar order, **[under the umbrella of economic
rationalism a government gradually abdicates responsibility for the
well-being of the disadvantaged or the sick. Such government initiatives
can precipitate a crisis of conscience, and responsibility (in the
juridical sense of either duty or blame) seems to vanish or falls
disproportionately toward women, particular racial and ethnic groups,
the socially disadvantaged and/or the dispossessed]{.underline}**.
**[Rather than examine this shift in the distribution of responsibility,
my concern is with the mechanism of the dampening of conscience that
disables it or precipitates its redistribution. This crisis, then
dampening, of conscience can manifest in different ways.]{.underline}**
**[Citizens may take the government initiative to be establishing an
exemplar for the ill-treatment or neglect of particular groups and,
without question or even passionately, hold those groups responsible for
their own suffering or for felt insecurity in a population, and follow
the government's example in their conduct toward these
'others']{.underline}**. Arguably, the race riot on Cronulla beach in
Sydney on 11 December 2005 (the week after that anti-terrorism
legislation was rushed through Parliament amid a flurry of publicity)
was a particularly graphic example of this 'flow-on' effect, where a
large group of flag-waving inebriated and largely Anglo-Celtic
Australians aggressively sought to 'protect their beach' from what they
felt to be an invasion by unwelcome Lebanese youth.6 While the Prime
Minister explained the riot in terms of isolated criminal behavior and
others viewed it as an eruption of wider suppressed racism, it could be
equally well explained in terms of an unthinking imitation, albeit
disordered and extreme, of norms of conduct toward particular groups
emerging from several years of a nationalistic politics of division and
fear that would direct blame for felt insecurity toward those considered
'un-Australian'. **[A dulling of conscience and disabling of
responsibility under such circumstances can take less spectacular but no
less affective forms.]{.underline}** Citizens may feel uncomfortable or
distressed about such trends but turn a blind eye in the belief either
that this is a localized problem or that the rule of law, more
compatible with their own moral sensibility, will be restored. Or
citizens may strongly oppose such government initiatives, and abhor
their flow-on effects, but, in the absence of any obvious culpable
agent, may feel powerless to do anything about it (after all, this is
government of the people by the people). In any case **[volatile
emotions or passive compliance or confusion about what is right and
wrong govern our conduct toward others. That we are reluctant or cannot
find someone to blame for acts carried out in accordance with such
government initiatives is in part because, insofar as modernity can be
characterized by anonymous government, as Foucault following Nietzsche
has analyzed, this involves a transfer of responsibility for upholding
law and moral norms from the state to the disciplined, self-governing
individual. Under such conditions liberal democratic governments can act
apparently without conscience but with impunity while the individual
citizens who bear the burden of responsibility, in the juridical sense,
seem unable to assume it. What is at issue when such governments seem to
initiate a reversal in customary standards of conduct toward others is
not only whether individuals should be held responsible for acts
committed in accordance with that regime, but also whether they have the
capacity to assume responsibility in any ensuing dulling of
conscience]{.underline}**. What happens to the capacity for
responsibility, and to the normative basis of conscience, judgment and
conduct, when the laws and moral norms we supposedly embody through a
disciplinary regime of anonymous government are undermined by that same
government which remains, nonetheless, anonymous and beyond judgment?
This was Arendt's concern. Not so much the transfer of responsibility
from the state to the individual or any ensuing failure of leadership in
upholding political responsibility, **[but the dulling of conscience and
failure of personal responsibility that follows. The government she had
in mind was totalitarian -- not a dictatorship, she hastens to add --
but totalitarian in the sense of government that reaches beyond the
political into all 'spheres of life' and that 'coordinates' human
existence toward, for example, a uniform national identity (PRD 33--4).7
Insofar as such government can be democratically elected and
enthusiastically embraced in times of felt insecurity, Arendt's question
as to why so many went along with and allowed themselves to be
'coordinated' by the Nazi reversal of law and moral norms is just as
pertinent now]{.underline}**, 30 years after she last asked it. As a
consequence of neglecting the corporeal and affective dimension of
conscience, Arendt, I will argue, cannot adequately explain how
conscience can be dampened and personal responsibility fail under such
government (I will turn to Nietzsche for that). But she does pinpoint
what is at stake in such a failure (the 'humanness' or value of persons)
and why conscience must be restored if the world of potentiality and
plurality that we share is to endure. I now draw together and
provisionally summarize her salient claims about conscience and
responsibility that move the meaning of responsibility away from,
without abandoning,

its juridical sense.

Ethics and Subjectivity: Practices of Self-Governance in the Late
Lectures of Michel Foucault

**[Yet, although he believes such ethical work might prepare for public
engagement, Foucault avoids any claim that such ethical cultivation
translates directly into political action. Individuals]{.underline}**
may **[have a richer set of ethical resources upon which to draw and
potentially enter politics, but it remains to them to make that choice.
Forcing that connection might be perilous. A clue to the perils of such
self-governance for politics appears in Alexander's famously reported
comment to Diogenes: "if I were not Alexander, I should like to be
Diogenes." Politically, this remark might be interpreted as reflective
of Alexander's own humility and of the moderation with which he
exercised his own power. Yet it also alerts us modern readers to another
danger: for Alexander to express himself as does Diogenes would be to
require him to be someone other than who he, in fact, is. It would be to
deny his currency, his powerful position, and the very real relations
that constitute the political and social terms of
communit]{.underline}**y---in Christian terms, it would be an act of
self-renunciation, while in Deleuzian terms it would be an act made from
longing.59 In both instances, **[the cost of longing or
self-renunciation would be that stability of mind and presence to
oneself that Foucault finds to be so difficult to establish and so
inherently fragile]{.underline}**. Renunciation and desire simply return
individuals to the unsteady longing to be other than what they are.
Paradoxically, the daily adjustments of parrhesia result in a greater
steadiness both in thought and action. **[Requiring individuals to be
otherwise is to unsettle them without educating them to the techniques
by which they might regain their balance. As a political program, then,
its effects will be fleeting, as individuals are unable to situate
themselves in these new ideals or to feel invested in the
relations]{.underline}**---to themselves, to others, to truth---that
sustain it.

Midgley argues in a semi-genealogical fashion that **[the current
tarnished image of morality]{.underline}**, by which she means its
equation with moralism and its vulnerability to social criticism, **[may
be traced back to an historical event. Somewhere back in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, morality became delimited in both law and
opinion as a province of social life and thoughts in its own right,
alongside politics]{.underline}**, economics, the fine arts and so on.
In identifying this representation as an historical-intellectual
development, Midgley predictably cites J. S. Mil's essay 'On liberty' as
a milestone in that history. In this essay, which is often regarded as
the definitive philosophical manifesto of liberalism, Mill delineates
**[a sphere of independent action and moral judgment for every morally
competent citizen of a modern (democratic) state. Independence is cashed
out in terms of Mill's famous distinction between private and public
domains. The ethical is thus defined as a domain of personal freedom of
thought and action; it is a private domain insofar as neither law nor
organized public opinion are permitted to intervene into this domain in
order to enforce collective moral strandards]{.underline}** (or even to
prevent self-inflicted damage).

The highest type, to Nietzsche\'s mind, is **[the passionate man who is
the master of his passions, able to employ them crea­tively without
having to resort to asceticism for fear that his passions might conquer
him. But not everybody is capable of this achievement, and Nietzsche
does not believe in the pos­sibility of a universal morality. He prefers
self-control and sub­limation to both license and asceticism, but
concedes that for some asceticism may be necessary. Those who require
such a radical prescription strike him as weaker, less powerful types
than men like Goethe, for example.]{.underline}** The will to power is,
according to Nietzsche, a universal drive, found in all men. It prompts
the slave who dreams of a heaven from which he hopes to behold his
master in hell no less than it prompts the master. Both resentment and
brutality, both sadism and asceticism are expressions of it. Indeed,
**[Nietz­sche thinks that all human behavior is reducible to this single
basic force. He does not endorse the will to power any more than Freud
endorses sexual desire; but he thinks we shall be better off if we face

Politics",[Project Muse") MF]{.underline}*

Let us remember the three points under criticism in the critical program
of virtue ethicists: the overreliance on rule models of moral choice,
the overly rationalistic accounts of moral agency, and the formalism
inherent in such theories. If we did not know that we are talking about
virtue ethicists, we would readily say that this pertains to Nietzsche.
**[Nietzsche does reject rule models. His ethics of creativity argues
that one must create values for oneself and not rely on any external
(transcendent) rule]{.underline}**. Nietzsche also fiercely rejects the
rationalistic account of moral agency. He struggles to rehabilitate the
repressed parts of human nature, claiming that reason is but a very
small part of ourselves. He talks of the human being in terms of a
fiction (see *D* 105). We are wronged in the conception of ourselves: we
are led to believe that we are neatly divided between reason and
instinct. But this division is illusory. The human being is a "social
structure of many 'souls'" (*BGE* 19). We possess a soul that is a
"social structure of the instincts and passions" (*BGE* 12). Nietzsche
says further that "\[i\]f we desired and dared an architecture
corresponding to the nature of *our* soul (we are too cowardly for
it!)---our model would have to be the labyrinth!" (*D* 169). We are
indeed very far from the traditional picture of the self and also far
from the superiority of reason that is proposed by traditional
philosophical approaches and moralities in particular. Last, it is also
evident that [**Nietzsche rejects the formalism inherent in traditional
moralities as he would generally reject any formalism in
thought**.]{.underline} Nietzsche does share the critical program of
virtue ethicists. **[The nihilism he proposes is supposed to remedy the
alienating traditional philosophical (and religious)
discourse]{.underline}**. But does he stop at the nihilistic moment? Is
his program purely nihilistic, as Leiter suggests? I have argued
elsewhere that far from being purely nihilistic, **[Nietzsche's
philosophy is entirely constructive.19 His challenge consists in
rejecting the existing morality to construct anew. The old system's
deficiencies cannot be adjusted by reorganization. One must erase
everything and start from scratch.]{.underline}** This is where his
attacks on morality come into play. In this moment Nietzsche announces
the death of God and its metaphysical import. Nietzsche is clear about
his self-attributed immoralism: "At bottom my expression *immoralist*
involves two denials. I deny first a type of man who has hitherto
counted as the highest, the *good*, the *benevolent*, *beneficent*; I
deny secondly a kind of morality which has come to be accepted and to
dominate as morality in itself---*décadence* morality, in more palpable
terms *Christian* morality" (*EH* "Destiny" 4[). **His rejection of
morality is thus clearly identified by him as a rejection of traditional
morality.**]{.underline} He also says of fellow immoralists, they "see
\[their\] honor in affirming" (*TI* "Morality" 6).20 There is no
question of abandoning ethics. Ethics is needed and will be his
preoccupation for the first steps of his reconstruction, for it was a
preoccupation before his reconstruction as it lead to the rejection of
the defective ethics. Nihilism is a necessary step toward this
reconstruction. As he says in *The Gay Science*: "**[We deny, and must
deny, because something in us *wants* to live and affirm itself,
something which we perhaps do not as yet know, do not as yet
see!"]{.underline} (**307). What is it that wants to affirm itself? In
*Schopenhauer as Educator*, Nietzsche says that "**[We are accountable
to ourselves for our own existence; consequently, we also want to be the
real helmsmen of our existence and keep it from resembling a mindless
coincidence]{.underline}**" (1). The Übermensch, in *Thus Spoke*
*Zarathustra*, is the figure who is successful in becoming his own
master. He is an Overman, more than a man, a human being that is human
and more[.]{.underline} Why more? The Übermensch is the individual who
has overcome the fragmentation inherent in tradition. It is the person
who has reunited himself, who has decided to live fully as he is. It is
also the person who knows that life is will to power and that he himself
is an instance of this will to power. Accordingly, he wishes to embody
and respect the will to power within himself. In addition to all of
this, he accepts the eternal return hypothesis. He is ready to suppose
that the actions and decisions he makes during his life will return
eternally the same. The change from man to Übermensch is
tremendous[.]{.underline} So much so that we cannot talk about an
elevation from man to Übermensch but really of a transfiguration, as
Nietzsche himself refers.21 Even the highest type of human being present
in Nietzsche's writings, the strong man, is far below the Übermensch. He
says: "Your souls are so unfamiliar with what is great that the Superman
would be *fearful* to you in his goodness! And you wise and enlightened
men, you would flee from the burning sun of wisdom in which the Superman
joyfully bathes his nakedness! You highest men my eyes have encountered!
This is my doubt of you and my secret laughter: I think you would call
my Superman---a devil!" (*Z* "Manly Prudence"). The Übermensch is an
ideal type of human being. Every individual should emulate this figure
as an illustration of what one can become if only one were to engage
oneself in the way of creation. When I speak of an ideal type, the
Übermensch, I mean that it is a figure toward which one must strive, not
to be confused as a state one can reach. For one thing, it is not clear
in Nietzsche's mind whether there will ever be *Übermenschen*. For
another thing, I think we should interpret the figure he presents to us
as a dynamic state of being. If the Übermensch accepts life and himself
as an instance of the will to power, he will be in constant becoming.
The drive for more power, characteristic of Nietzsche's being, will lead
the individual into a continuous flux and constant overcoming of
oneself. This is how one should understand the *Über* of *Übermensch*.
But even if we are talking about a "state of flux," this is a state that
one should strive to acquire while engaging in the process of
attainment. According to Nietzsche[,]{.underline} there are certain
things that one must do in order to approach this excellence and in turn
become an Übermensch. Among these things are [**the creation of oneself
and** **the creation of values that is essential in supporting a new
ethics. The human being should be the creator of oneself**]{.underline}.
She should be her own master and define her own rules (which is what is
truly meant by the famous, or infamous, "Master morality").22 Once the
sky of values has been emptied, the task is to fill it again for
oneself. The individual should no longer rely on any transcendent to
provide these values, as the previous experiment of Christianity and its
transcendent morals has proven that its only possible result is
alienation[.]{.underline} **[Human beings must create an ethics for
human beings. The individual must create an ethics that respects one's
nature as human and as will to power.]{.underline}** This is expressed
in Nietzsche's maxim: "*What Saith thy Conscience*?---Thou shalt become
what thou art" (*GS* 270). You must flourish! Note that there is nothing
in Nietzsche's writings until *Beyond Good and Evil* that indicates that
the way of the Übermensch is bared for certain individuals. He makes
clear that this potentiality exists in every individual. It is only a
matter of the individual choosing to actualize his or her own self as
will to power.23 Thus the emphasis is placed on the flourishing of the
agent via the adoption of certain virtues in line with one's own being.

## Any project that defines a universal ethical claim fosters indifference.

(Jeffrey, Department of Geology, East Carolina University,
"Poststructuralist ethics: subjectivity, responsibility and the space of
community"[Sage) MF]{.underline}

From an empirical perspective, these insights have provoked a
re-examination of geographical phenomena in a wide range of domains,
with emphasis increasingly placed upon the ways in which social meanings
and categories take on the *appearance* of truth or objectivity. Recent
work has examined, for example, the discourses governing geopolitics (Ó
Tuathail, 1996; Ó Tuathail and Dalby, 1998), the economy (Barnes, 1996;
Gibson-Graham, 1996), urban space (Soja, 1996; Dear, 2000), colonialism
and development (Jacobs, 1996; Yapa, 1996), the environment (Braun and
Castree, 1998) and the nature of identity, particularly the spatial
structuring of gender/sexual and racial/ethnic difference (Sibley, 1995;
Dwyer and Jones, 2000; Nast, 2000). The poststructuralist intervention
has also prompted a series of philosophical debates, which have posed a
challenge to traditional understandings of metaphysics and epistemology.
In this more theoretical vein, poststructuralism offers a critique of
logocentrism, the centering or grounding of claims to truth or
objectivity . From this perspective, the apparent stability of meaning
embedded in any system of thought is potentially destabilized by elided
traces of difference, and by the multiple contexts in which knowledge is
produced, received and interpreted. As Strohmayer and Hannah (1992: 36)
put it, 'the truth of any statement, scientific or otherwise, which
ultimately must rely on some anchoring in order to avoid being
completely arbitrary, is [*undecidable*.' This 'deconstruction' of
universals poses a significant challenge to traditional understandings
of ethics, for the anti-foundational stance of poststructuralism implies
that **any project aimed at defining *an* ethics, or *a* normative
theory of society, would be doomed to failure**]{.underline}**.** From a
poststructuralist perspective, **[universal claims to knowledge and
truth can become a barrier to fostering a sensitivity to difference, and
thus ethics would need to find its purchase in the radical instability
of meaning and the deconstruction of universal normative
claims]{.underline}**. The goal of such an anti-essentialist approach,
as David Slater (1997: 69) has noted, is to cultivate a 'political
openness, or an "ungrounded ground", where foundations or norms or
universal prescriptions only exist to be put into question as a
permanent feature of the process of democratization'. Some commentators
have gone so far as to suggest that [**we should take up a position
against ethics, in the sense of a model of moral or ethical actions, and
instead work to foster 'an ethics of encounter without a commitment to
resolution or closure**']{.underline} (Campbell and Shapiro, 1999a: xi,
xvii; see also Caputo, 1993). I will try below to suggest how we might
imagine such an 'ethics of encounter', but first I turn to examine some
of the responses within geography to the postmodern challenge to ethics.

## Their form of moral absolutism prioritizes clean moral hands over moral results: they are more concerned with not acting directly immoral than preventing much larger immoral consequences

**Nielsen 1993** (Kai, Phil. Prof @ U. Calgary, Absolutism and It
Consequentialist Critics, ed. Joram Graf Haber, p. 170-2)

Blowing up the fat man is indeed monstrous. But letting him remain stuck
while the whole group drowns is still more monstrous. The
consequentialist is on strong moral ground here, and, if his reflective
moral convictions do not square either with certain unrehearsed or with
certain reflective particular moral convictions of human beings, so much
the worse for such commonsense moral convictions. One could even
usefully and relevantly adapt here-though for a quite different
purpose-an argument of Donagan\'s. Consequentialism of the kind I have
been arguing for provides so persuasive \"a theoretical basis for common
morality that when it contradicts some moral intuition, it is natural to
suspect that intuition, not theory, is corrupt.\" Given the
comprehensiveness, plausibility, and overall rationality of
consequentialism, it is not unreasonable to override even a deeply felt
moral conviction if it does not square with such a theory, though, if it
made no sense or overrode the bulk of or even a great many of our
considered moral convictions that would be another matter indeed
Anticonsequentialists often point to the inhumanity of people who will
sanction such killing of the innocent but cannot the compliment be
returned by speaking of the even greater inhumanity, conjoined with
evasiveness, of those who will allow even more death and far greater
misery and then excuse themselves on the ground that they did not intend
the death and misery but merely forbore to prevent it? In such a
context, such reasoning and such forbearing to prevent seems to me to
constitute a moral evasion. I say it is evasive because rather than
steeling himself to do what in normal circumstances would be a horrible
and vile act but in this circumstance is a harsh moral necessity he
\[it\] allows, when he has the power to prevent it, a situation which is
still many times worse. He tries to keep his \'moral purity\' and \[to\]
avoid \'dirty hands\' at the price of utter moral failure and what
Kierkegaard called \'double-mindedness.\' It is understandable that
people should act in this morally evasive way but this does not make it
right.

## Ignoring consequences is immoral - they sacrifice others to preserve moral purity. It is most moral to act to produce the best end regardless of the moral cleanliness of the means

Ailinsky 1971 (Saul D., Activist, Prof, Social Organizer with Int\'l
Fame, Founder of Industrial Areas Foundation, Rules for Radicals, p.
24-7)

\"Does this particular end justify this particular means?\" Life and how
you live it is the story of means and ends. The end is what you want,
and the means is how you get it. Whenever we think about social change,
the question of means and ends arises. The person \[man\] of action
views the issue of means and ends in pragmatic and strategic terms. He
has no other problem; he thinks only of his actual resources and the
possibilities of various choices of action. He asks of ends only whether
they are achievable and worth the cost; of means, only whether they will
work. To say that corrupt means corrupt the ends is to believe in the
immaculate conception of ends and principles. The real arena is corrupt
and bloody. Life is a corrupting process from the time a child learns to
play his mother off against his father in the politics of when to go to
bed; he who fears corruption fears life. The practical revolutionary
will understand Geothe\'s [\"]{.underline}conscience is the virtue of
observers and not of agents of action in action one does not always
enjoy the luxury of a decision that is consistent both with one s
individual conscience and the good of \[humankind. The choice must
always be for the latter. Action is for mass salvation and not for the
individual\'s personal salvation. He \[or she1 who sacrifices the mass
good for his personal conscience has peculiar conception of \"personal
salvation\"; he doesn\'t care enough for people to be \"corrupted\" for
them. The people \[men\] who pile up the heaps of discussion and
literature on the ethics of means and ends-which with rare exception is
conspicuous for its sterility-rarely write about their won experiences
in the perpetual struggle of life and change. They are strangers,
moreover, to the burdens and problems of operational responsibility and
the unceasing pressure for immediate decisions. They are passionately
committed to a mystical objectivity where passions are suspect. They
assume a nonexistent situation where men dispassionately and with reason
draw and devise means and ends as if studying a navigational chart on
land. They can be recognized by one of two verbal brands; \"We agree
with the ends but not the means,\" or \"This is not the time.\" The
means-and- end moralists or non-doers always wind up on their ends
without any means. The means-and- \'ends moralists, constantly obsessed
with the ethics of the means used by the Have-Nots against the Haves,
should search themselves as to their real political position. In fact,
they are passive-but real-allies of the Haves. They are the ones Jacques
Maritain referred to in his statement, \"The fear of soiling ourselves
by entering the context of history is not virtue, but a way of escaping
virtue.\" These non-doers were the ones who chose not to fight the Nazis
in the only way they could have been fought; they were the ones who drew
their window blinds to shut out the shameful spectacle of Jews and
political prisoners being dragged through the streets; they were the
ones who privately deplored the horror of it all-and did nothing. This
is the nadir of immorality. The most unethical of all means is the
nonuse of any means[.]{.underline} It is this species of man who so
vehemently and militantly participated in that classically idealistic
debate at the old League of Nations on the ethical differences between
defensive and offensive weapons. Their fears of action drive them to
refuge in an ethics so divorced from the politics of life that it can
apply only to angels, not to men. The standards ofjudgment must be
rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived, the world as
it is, not our wished-for fantasy of the world as it should be. 1
present here a series of rules pertaining to the ethics of means and
ends: first, that one\'s concern with the ethics of means and ends
varies inversely with one\'s personal interest in the issue. When we are
not directly concerned our morality overflows; as La Rochefoucauld put
it, \"We all have strength enough to endure the misfortunes of others.\"

Irvine Configurations, 2007, 15:151--175 © 2009 by The Johns Hopkins
University Press and the Society for Literature and Science.

**[\
To be sure, in the late project on ethics, Foucault does not propose a
new version of the liberal notion of the autonomous individual,
self-reliant and free, one who builds a stable identity, like the comic
character Baron von Munchausen, by lifting himself up by his own
bootstraps. This Western conceit is, after all, the main subject of
Foucault's critique, and the chief preoccupation of his work. The post
structuralist in fact presents his notion of self-subjectivation as an
alternative, and overlooked or repressed, stream of thinking in the
West]{.underline}**, one that has been overshadowed by the injunction
"know thyself**[."Foucault formulates the tradition he points to as "the
care of self," implying that this somewhat underground alternative
culturemight provide resources in the present for new types of
emancipator endeavors. Here he takes his cue from Nietzsche, who foresaw
a"transvaluation of values" in which ethics would be based not on
renunciation and self restraint but on aesthetics]{.underline}**.31
Foucault anticipates the project of the hermeneutics of the subject
contributing to a culture in which "everyone's life \[might\] become a
work of art."32 I shall raise the question of the care of self in
relation to cosmeticsurgery reality TV, but before embarking on this
project, a thorough understanding is required of Foucault's idea of the
care of self. In the 1982 lectures at the Collège de France, Foucault
presented a genealogy of ethics in the ancient world, concentrating on
the Hellenistic period where "the care of self" reached its richest
point of development. He contrasts the care of self with the relation to
the self in Platonism, Christianity, and modern philosophy, primarily
Descartes. In all three cases, **[Foucault strives to distinguish the
care of self as a "spiritual" practice in which the self is transformed.
In the care of self, the self is not discovered as it is in Descartes,
or realized in its authenticity as it is in Sartre; rather, Hellenistic
care of self is a complex of lifelong practices in which the individual
attempts to change himself/herself. It is not a case of attempting to
discover the truth of oneself, as in Plato, or to convert oneself in the
image]{.underline}** of a transcendent principle, as in Christianity.
Here is one definition Foucault gives of the Hellenistic care of the
self: The Greeks of the Hellenistic period developed a culture of
self-constitution, potentially open to all, through meditation, writing
exercises, group meetings, and other practices. The direct goal was an
art of living, an aesthetic of self-relation, an ethic of spiritual
formation.

University Press and the Society for Literature and Science.

One more aspect of Foucault's position must be clarified before I begin.
As we have seen, Foucault rarely addresses the idea of the care of self
in relation to contemporary culture. But **[one distinction about the
care of self is crucial and must be borne in mind.]{.underline}** In
response to a question from Paul Rabinow and Hubert Dreyfus
**[suggesting the common narcissism in modern society and ancient Greek
ethics, Foucault offers the following comment: "In the Californian cult
of the self, one is supposed to discover one's true self. . . . not only
do I not identify this ancient culture of the self with what you might
call the Californian cult of the self, I think they are diametrically
opposed."]{.underline}** 40 If *I Want a Famous Face* and *The Swan* are
understood only as depictions of individuals in quest of their true
selves, then clearly the issue is not one that concerns Foucault's idea
of the care of self. I want rather to inquire if there is a hint of care
of self in these most abject television series. **[For as Foucault
writes, our culture, complex as it is, does not easily support this
idea: "We have hardly any remnant of the idea in our society that the
principal work of art which one must take care of, the main area to
which one must apply aesthetic values, is oneself, one's life, one's
existence."]{.underline}**41 Surgeries Reexamined The question I shall
pose in relation to *The Swan* and *I Want a Famous* *Face* is this:
What can be learned about these shows when they are approached from the
vantage point of the concept of the care of self? And what does such an
interrogation reveal about popular culture at a time when the media are
disseminated throughout society ever more densely and with increasing
variation and intermediation?42

## Aesthetic judgments, or judgments free of bias and societal opinion, are the best alternatives to judging morals and ethics without placing our own vanity and egos as the hidden priority {#aesthetic-judgments-or-judgments-free-of-bias-and-societal-opinion-are-the-best-alternatives-to-judging-morals-and-ethics-without-placing-our-own-vanity-and-egos-as-the-hidden-priority .Tags}

**Downard 04\**
(Northern Arizona University. *Nietzsche and Kant on the Pure Impulse of
Truth*. [The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 27]{.underline})

**[Nietzsche maintains that art and not morality is the origin of our
pure impulse to truth.]{.underline}** I believe that **[Nietzsche\'s
purpose in appealing to art is to find a basis for establishing and
perhaps improving our freedom as inquirers. According to both Nietzsche
and Kant, aesthetic judgments express a special kind of freedom. Kant
maintains that this freedom surpasses even the autonomy of our moral
agency.]{.underline}**
**[[^11^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v027/27.1downard.html#FOOT11)
Like moral judgments, aesthetic judgments must be free from any given
inclination or contingent purpose. Unlike moral judgments, aesthetic
judgments must be free from any given concept or principle, including
the ends and principles of reason]{.underline}**. Given Nietzsche\'s
larger philosophical project, this fact makes it easy to see why he
would appeal to art. His question is one of how the capacity to act from
a pure impulse ever evolved from natural inclinations. Furthermore, he
wants to give an account of how this capacity evolved that does not make
an appeal to either language or reason. It is the independence of art
from both the concepts embodied in language and the principles of reason
that makes art an especially appealing candidate. At this point, I would
like to review the general features of Kant\'s account of aesthetic
judgment. At the same time, I will offer some textual evidence **\[End
Page 30\]** for thinking that there are substantial agreements between
Kant and Nietzsche about the nature of aesthetic judgments. In his early
essay on truth, Nietzsche does not offer an account of aesthetic
judgment. As such, I would like to start by briefly reviewing the
agreements that Nietzsche expresses in both *The Birth of Tragedy* and
*Zarathustra* with Kant\'s aesthetics. According to both Kant and
Nietzsche, there are two types of aesthetic judgments. We experience the
sublime when we confront the infinitude of abysses, mountains, and
storms. We experience the beautiful when we hear the harmony of a piano
sonata or see the unity in a painting. Setting to the side the
differences between these two types of judgments, let us focus on the
points that are common to both. Kant\'s analytic is an attempt to make
sense of three conflicting intuitions that we share about aesthetics.
[^[12]{.underline}^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v027/27.1downard.html#FOOT12)
On the one hand, matters of art are a matter of personal taste.
Aesthetic estimations are subjective judgments. Because they are
subjective, there are no objective proofs to which we could appeal to
settle disputes. At the same time, we do quarrel about matters of beauty
and sublimity. If I find a painting beautiful and you think it is ugly,
we take ourselves to be engaged in a real disagreement even if there are
no objective grounds to settle the dispute. In order to help settle our
quarrel, I might point to the harmony of shapes, while you might point
to the unattractive colors. **[Nietzsche maintains that the distinction
between the subjective and the objective cannot be used in aesthetics to
do any philosophical work. Nietzsche\'s main point, like Kant\'s, is
that aesthetic judgments are not merely subjective. They are not
expressions of what is merely agreeable for an individual. A judgment of
taste cannot be based on the satisfaction of personal preferences: \"the
striving individual bent on furthering his egoistic purposes---can be
thought of only as an enemy to art, never as its source\" (*BT,* 41). At
the same time, aesthetic judgments are not determinative judgments, for
there are no objective grounds for matters of taste. Nietzsche
challenges the idea that aesthetics is grounded on standards of reason
(*Z,* 166). He wants to suggest that the aesthetics must be independent
of such determinate concepts and principles.]{.underline}** Nietzsche
recognizes that there can be quarrels over matters of taste. In fact, he
elevates the idea to a crucial position in his argument in *Zarathustra*
when he challenges those who would maintain that judgments of taste are
merely subjective expressions of personal preference: \"\[t\]aste---that
is at the same time weight and scales and weigher; and woe unto all the
living that would live without disputes over weight and scales and
weighers!\" (*Z,* 117). **[The fundamental prerequisite to being a
self-conqueror is that one overcome one\'s personal biases and
prejudices]{.underline}**. According to Kant\'s transcendental analysis,
judgments of taste must be grounded on a disinterested pleasure. In
order for the pleasure that we take in an aesthetic experience to be
disinterested, we must seek a higher ground for our judgments. In
exercising **\[End Page 31\]** his judgment, Zarathustra tells us that
he \"had to fly to the highest spheres that (he) might find the fount of
pleasure again\" (*Z,* 98). **[Not only do we need to set aside our
interest in what we find agreeable and what we find to be consistent
with our prudential interests, but we must also set aside our interest
in satisfying the requirements of morality]{.underline}** (*BT,* 142).
**[According to Kant\'s analysis, aesthetic judgments must be purposive
without any given purpose. Zarathustra teaches us to live without any
dependence upon given ends. He urges us to renounce any servitude under
given purposes. Often, Nietzsche refers to such a condition as a matter
of chance or accident. It is through the purposiveness of art that
purposes grow from mere accidents]{.underline}** (*Z,* 62).
**[Purposiveness is realized where harmony and unity are restored to
what was merely fragmentary]{.underline}**. Under the last two moments
of Kant\'s analysis, aesthetic judgments must make claims of subjective
universality and subjective necessity. **[When we estimate the beauty or
sublimity of an object, we make claims to the effect that all other
human beings ought to agree with our judgment.]{.underline}**
**[[^13^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v027/27.1downard.html#FOOT13)
The judgment is universal insofar as it makes a claim on *all* others.
According to Nietzsche, judgments of taste help us to become reconciled
to one another by teaching the \"gospel of universal
harmony\"]{.underline}** (*BT,* 19-24). A judgment of taste is necessary
insofar as it makes a claim on how others *ought* to estimate the
object. According to Nietzsche, in the Apollonian state we experience
dreams with a sense of real necessity. For Zarathustra, the \"Thou shalt
is higher than to command for those that are sublime\" (*Z,* 48).
Nietzsche recognizes that it is possible to make such claims of
necessity only where you have set aside personal biases and prejudices.
**[As such, you can only make such claims where you call this cessation
of all need \"necessity\"]{.underline}** (*Z,* 77, 222). So far, we have
reviewed the agreements between Kant and Nietzsche on aesthetic
judgments and have found them to be in substantial agreement on major
points. The fact that the agreements are found in both *The Birth of
Tragedy* and *Zarathustra* is evidence that Nietzsche did not
dramatically alter his position on these points in aesthetics between
his early and later periods.
[^[14]{.underline}^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v027/27.1downard.html#FOOT14)
Furthermore, the fact that \"Truth and Falsity in Their Ultramoral
Sense\" and *The Birth of Tragedy* were published at about the same time
indicates that Nietzsche was likely working with such ideas in his early
essay on truth. Kant tells us that the key to the critique of taste is
in the solution to the following problem. The question is whether the
feeling of pleasure that we take in an aesthetic judgment follows from
the judgment, or whether the feeling of pleasure precedes the judgment.
[^[15]{.underline}^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v027/27.1downard.html#FOOT15)
Only if the feeling of pleasure follows from the judgment is the
judgment free from determination by external causes. Only if the
judgment is free from such causes can we presume to require that others
agree with our judgment. **[As an aesthetic reflective
judgment]{.underline}**, \[End Page 32**\]** **[the basis for the
correctness of the judgment is the complete freedom of the
subject.]{.underline}** Here we find what may be the key to
understanding Nietzsche\'s account of aesthetic judgments. In
Nietzsche\'s terms, the purely perspectival character of aesthetic
judgments is the key to their legislative authority. For Kant, one who
is engaged in an act of aesthetic judgment can tell us how we ought to
judge because only a subjective necessity is presupposed by such
judgments. Taste claims a special kind of autonomy. Only where we have
overcome all of the external causes of bias in judgment, including the
tyranny of our feelings, the tyranny of reason (scientific, prudential,
and moral) and even the tyranny of the object and the truth of its
existence, does our judgment have autonomy. Only where autonomy has been
realized can we presume to tell others how they ought to judge, assuming
that they have adopted an aesthetic perspective and distanced themselves
from their own biases and prejudices. The structural similarities
between Kant\'s two arguments against consequentialism are striking. In
both Kant\'s ethics and his aesthetics, the issue is one of the purity
of the judgment. **[Because of the structural similarities between the
two arguments, we can make the same kinds of arguments against
rationalist and empiricist accounts of truth from the perspective of art
as can be made from the perspective of ethics. On Kant\'s account,
aesthetic reflective judgments share some of the same features as
determinative moral judgments. Most important, aesthetic reflective
judgments are categorical in their form even though they are singular
judgments and are not determined by an objective principle of reason.
Because they are categorical and not hypothetical, aesthetic judgments
must be grounded in a pure impulse]{.underline}**. Kant claims that the
experience of the sublime teaches us to esteem in opposition to our
interests and that the experience of the beautiful teaches us to love.
**[In a similar fashion, Nietzsche claims that the experience of the
sublime gives us a height above our vanity and the experience of the
beautiful teaches how to love something, such as the truth, from a pure
impulse]{.underline}** (*Z,* 116-18).

**Downard 04\**
(Northern Arizona University. *Nietzsche and Kant on the Pure Impulse of
Truth*. [The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 27]{.underline})

**[Why should we think that Nietzsche is right to claim that art is the
origin of our pure impulse to truth]{.underline}**? Why shouldn\'t we
agree with Kant that a pure impulse to the truth can and should be
grounded in practical reason? I believe that **[Nietzsche can make the
same criticism of Kant that he has made of empiricist and especially
rationalist accounts of truth. Namely, that on certain questions,
Kant\'s account of truth is grounded in a principle of self-love. The
main \[End Page 37\] reason Kant falls prey to such an objection is that
there are a whole host of questions Kant is unable or unwilling to admit
are real questions.]{.underline}** Let us start with Nietzsche\'s
example of honesty. According to Kant, why should we be honest? The
answer is that any minimally rational agent recognizes a duty to be
honest. Rational agents need no further reason to do their duty because
the principles of morality give them overriding reasons to be moral. On
Kant\'s account, can a moral agent honestly question what it is to be
honest? What I mean is, supposing the circumstances are perfectly clear,
and supposing that there are no apparent conflicts of duty, can a moral
agent honestly raise the question, what ought I to do? Kant maintains
that any minimally rational agent already knows the answer. Such an
agent may feel a temptation to violate the duty to be honest, but the
agent recognizes that the duty to be honest should always be given the
highest respect. Nietzsche seems to think that we can raise honest
questions about our values. On the one hand, the requirements of
conscience do appear to impose necessary obligations for our conscience.
On the other hand, we can raise questions about what, in particular, is
required by an obligation. Furthermore, we can raise questions about the
legitimacy of an obligation itself. As moral agents, we realize that
social traditions and personal biases may unduly affect our conception
of the requirements of morality. Even those requirements of conscience
that seem the clearest and the strongest may, in a manner great or
small, be infected by certain biases and prejudices. Kant insists that
all minimally rational agents know what duty requires and, as such, are
aware of the principles of morality. When a question about the
requirements of morality arises, all we need to do is carefully abstract
from our personal biases and prejudices and focus our attention on the
principles that are innate to our power of practical reason. In effect,
the answers to any moral questions that might arise are already
contained in the principles embedded in our conscience. We can rest
assured that the principles are absolutely universal and necessary. As a
system of principles, the set is complete, consistent, and unchanging.
Why does Kant believe that the system of moral principles has these
general features**? [In ethics, he takes a stronger stand than he does
in natural science. The ideas of freedom, immortality, and God are
regulative ideas that are justified only as practical postulates. But
the ideas that the requirements of morality are absolutely universal,
necessary, complete, consistent, and unchanging are constitutive of the
very idea of a categorical imperative. In ethics, we know with
significantly more certainty that the requirements of morality really do
have these general features.]{.underline}**
[[^20^](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_nietzsche_studies/v027/27.1downard.html#FOOT20)
**Nietzsche is free to question Kant\'s assumptions on such general
points. How do we know the truth about honesty with such certainty?
Kant\'s response is that we just know the principles of morality.
Nietzsche\'s point is that such a response is empty. It is not an answer
to the question. Rather, it is an attempt \[End Page 38\] to avoid the
question**]{.underline}. Why does Kant seek to avoid the question? His
reason seems to be that the question leads us to skepticism about the
requirements of morality. A natural response to Kant\'s worry is that
such questions may lead us to be skeptical about claims to certainty in
ethics, but it is an open question as to whether or not we need such
certainty in ethics. **[Kant\'s mistake was to turn his back on
questions that we ought not ignore. He closes the door to inquiry by
setting to the side questions to which we ought to seek answers. That is
a bad habit to inculcate. Nietzsche\'s criticism works equally well
against both the rationalists and Kant (*GM,* 289-92). The attempt to
avoid real questions by saying that the question has no answer, or by
simply assuming an answer, is ultimately grounded on
vanity]{.underline}**. The fact that you happen not to like the
consequences that follow from the question is not sufficient reason to
set the question to the side. Kant would have been better off to forward
such claims as regulative principles. He could have made his claims
about the absolute necessity and universality of the principles of duty
as transcendental hypotheses. While such a move would have avoided
premature claims to certainty, it would not remove Nietzsche\'s
objection. As a hypothesis, the claim that the principles of practical
reason are absolutely universal and necessary is not a good hypothesis.
The problem is not that it is false. **[For all we know, the principles
of morality may be absolutely necessary and universal. The problem is
that, as a hypothesis, it does not answer real questions. How can I be
so sure that my understanding of my moral duties is correct? I have a
clear understanding of the principles of morality and it is plausible to
suppose that those principles are absolute. Simply asserting that the
principles of morality are absolutely universal and necessary does not
answer the question, regardless of whether the assertions are forwarded
with certainty or only as hypotheses.]{.underline}** Having made what I
take to be the main point of Nietzsche\'s criticism in his early essay
on truth, and having turned the criticism toward Kant\'s ethics, let us
step back and consider how he might have obtained the upper hand in the
debate. The main question is, When engaged in inquiry, why ought I to
commit myself to standards of correctness in general? Kant and Nietzsche
agree that the pursuit of truth must be grounded on a free impulse.
**[The advantage of modeling the standards of correctness on aesthetic
judgments and not moral judgments of duty is the following. The former
but not the latter are free from determination by any given purpose or
rule. As such, Nietzsche does not need to make nearly as many
presumptions about the nature of truth as Kant. The fact that aesthetic
judgments are not determined by objective principles was thought to be
their greatest weakness. But Nietzsche seeks to turn a weakness into a
source of strength. The greatest strength of aesthetic judgments is
their superior freedom from such presumptions. Aesthetic judgments are a
natural model for such hypotheses because neither makes a claim \[End
Page 39\] to truth. When we forward a hypothesis, we say that it would
explain a certain phenomenon if it were truth. We think it is a
plausible conjecture, but we do not (at least yet) claim that it is
true. Similarly, the freedom of an aesthetic judgment is predicated upon
its independence from any claims to truth]{.underline}**. Nietzsche
wants to raise further questions. What is the origin of our pure impulse
to the truth? How can beings that were once governed entirely by
self-interest ever gain the capacity for freedom? In order to gain the
upper hand on these questions, Nietzsche does not need to assume that
the capacity to act from pure impulses did in fact evolve from natural
inclinations. The main advantage to his position is not merely that he
can give answers to questions that Kant cannot. Rather, the main
advantage to his position is that he can raise the questions in the
first place. Because he does not need to presuppose the status of any
rules or ends, he is free to pursue any line of inquiry whatsoever, let
the consequences of what he discovers be damned. **[Once we have decided
to address such questions in the terms of art, we have new resources
available to us. Instead of having to ignore certain difficulties, we
can stare them in the face. For Nietzsche, overcoming our servitude to
vanity is the greatest hurdle: \"Nature threw away the key; and woe to
the fatal curiosity which might be able for a moment to look out and
down through a crevice in the chamber of consciousness, and discover
that man is indifferent to his own ignorance, is resting on the
pitiless, the greedy, the insatiable, the murderous, and, as it were,
hanging in dreams on the back of a tiger\" (TF, 177). Ultimately, the
way in which we need to face such challenges is to let the sublimity of
the task remind us of the sublimity in ourselves.]{.underline}**

**Downard 04\**
(Northern Arizona University. *Nietzsche and Kant on the Pure Impulse of
Truth*. [The Journal of Nietzsche Studies 27]{.underline})

All four types of moral theories fall prey to the same objection. The
principles that they hold up as the primary principle of morality all
have the form of a hypothetical imperative. Hypothetical imperatives
establish only that a means is good relative to some end. In order to
show that a given end is worth \[End Page 27\] pursuing, all of these
moral theorists simply assert that we are inclined toward such an end
either because it is something that we desire, or because we have
rational impulses that move us in such a direction. **[According to
Kant,]{.underline}** all such incentives, regardless of whether they are
empirical or rational in character, are impure. As such, they fail to
express our freedom as moral agents. Only an incentive of respect that
is generated by an awareness of the categorical imperative is pure. The
reason is that only a principle of this form expresses our autonomy as
moral agents. The difference is a matter of priority**[. The feeling of
respect is pure because it follows from the moral law. All other moral
theories use a form of justification that puts the incentive first and
the principle second. At this point, let us turn to Nietzsche\'s
argument against both rationalist and empiricist accounts of
truth]{.underline}**. I hope to show that Nietzsche\'s criticisms can be
defended using Kant\'s moral argument against consequentialism. If
Nietzsche\'s criticisms can be defended in this manner, then his
criticisms will work against any philosophical account of truth that is
grounded on a principle of self-love. The targets of Nietzsche\'s
criticisms in his early essay on truth can be divided, according to
Kant\'s table, along the axes of subjective and objective accounts.
Taking them in reverse order from Kant\'s argument, let us first examine
rationalist accounts of truth. According to Nietzsche, such theories
posit the following kinds of claims. **[Rational beings control their
behavior entirely by abstractions. Their aim is to avoid being carried
away by a disorderly array of perceptual impressions. Abstract concepts
can be put into a pyramidal order of genus and species, with the unruly
impressions residing at the bottom. Standing back, looking at the
pyramid that we have constructed, we are impressed by those concepts
that are \"more fixed, general, known, human of the two and therefore
the regulating and imperative one]{.underline}**\" (TF, 181). **[In
creating such a world of concepts, our conduct is regulated by
imperatives. These imperatives guide the conduct of our inquiry and
determine how we ought to form concepts and distinguish between those
assertions that are worthy of being believed and those that ought to be
treated as false. The target of Nietzsche\'s criticism is, first and
foremost, the imperatives that rationalists think should guide the
conduct of our inquiry, and only secondly the beliefs that are held to
be true at any given time as a result of following those
imperatives]{.underline}**. Nietzsche makes his criticism of rationalist
accounts of truth in the following terms. When someone hides something
behind a bush and looks for it again in the same place and finds it
there as well, there is not much to praise in such seeking and finding.
Yet this is how matters stand regarding seeking and finding \"truth\"
within the realm of reason. If I make up the definition of a mammal, and
then, after inspecting a camel, declare \"look, a mammal\" I have indeed
brought a truth to light in this way, but it is a truth of limited
value. \[End Page 28\] Nietzsche\'s criticism has the same structure as
Kant\'s criticism of Wolff\'s moral theory. **[On both accounts, the
mistake of the rationalists was to assume that merely logical principles
could establish how we ought to conduct ourselves---either morally or in
scientific inquiry. Logical principles cannot establish what we ought to
hold as true any more than they can establish ends that are morally
worthy of our pursuit.]{.underline}** In order to hide this flaw,
rationalists try to sneak in a given end or belief. But the question
remains, is that end really worth pursuing and is that assertion really
worth believing? We should note that **[Nietzsche does not assert that
the belief adopted on the basis of such a procedure is false. Rather, he
says that it has limited value as a truth. The reason is that the belief
is,]{.underline}** to some extent**[, improved by following the
rationalists\' method. It is rendered more consistent and harmonious
with all the other assertions that are held to be true. But the
rationalists have failed to use a method that honestly asks whether or
not the belief itself is worthy of being believed]{.underline}**. By way
of contrast, empiricists explain the origins of our beliefs in the
following kinds of terms. A habitual relation between a word and certain
images is caused by mere repetition. A nerve stimulus causes an image to
appear in our consciousness as a sound or a sight. Objects external to
us cause the stimulation of our nerves. Nietzsche\'s first point against
an empiricist account is that the appeal to an object outside of us is
the \"result of a wrong and unjustifiable application of the concept of
causality\" (TF, 177). This concept has led empiricists to formulate a
chain of causes, each one explaining what follows it in the series.
Empiricists such as Hobbes and Hume openly assume that all objects have
the same basic nature (material objects for Hobbes and conscious
impressions for Hume), and all relations between things must be
understood in terms of *de facto* causes. But insufficient justification
is given for the presumption that words, images, nerve impulses, and
objects external to us all have the same nature and can all stand in
causal relations to one another. Empiricists believe that these kinds of
philosophical assumptions should guide our inquiry. **[Nietzsche takes
issue first and foremost with the imperatives that they think should
regulate our conduct. What is the basis of these
imperatives]{.underline}**? Why not think that there is a difference in
kind between nerve impulses and conscious images? Why not think that the
relation between the two is fundamentally an aesthetic relation and not
a merely *de facto* causal relation? The question that Nietzsche puts to
the empiricists is at root the same as the question he puts to the
rationalists**[. The point of Nietzsche\'s criticism of both
rationalists and empiricists can be understood by considering his
account of our move from the state of nature to the state of society. In
order to end the war of all against all, human beings forge a peace
treaty in which they agree to use concepts according to fixed
conventions. This treaty establishes the difference between truth and
lie. The]{.underline}** \[End Page 29**[\] honest person follows the
fixed conventions, the liar uses the fixed conventions to make things
that are \"unreal appear to be real\"]{.underline}** (TF, 2). He
reverses the fixed conventions and says, for example, \"I am honest,\"
when the correct word for his actions is \"dishonest.\" The liar misuses
the proper designations for his own selfish purposes and causes harm to
others. **[The majority of people follow the established conventions,
but are their actions any less fraudulent? What the majority of people
hate is not being deceived, but the harmful consequences of being
deceived. Once again, Nietzsche does not assert that there is no value
to such a grade of truth. Rather, he wants to question whether there is
a higher grade of truth that we ought to pursue. The point of his
criticism of both rationalists and empiricists is to question whether or
not the imperatives that they recommend for the conduct of our inquiry
can lift us out of the this state. In this state, we can establish a
certain peace. We can rest in confidence that the fixed conventions have
the status of accepted certainties. But we lack freedom. Nietzsche does
not believe that either account can improve our freedom. The reason is
that neither teaches us to act from a pure impulse to truth. Rather,
they encourage us to seek the pleasant consequences of preserving the
fixed conventions]{.underline}**.

## Kant's categorical imperative results in duty being impersonal.

**[With this point in mind, Nietzsche takes Kant's categorical

idiocy']{.underline}** (A,11). **[The ideas of a good-in-itself and
universal]{.underline}** (noncontextual) **[notions of cirtue and duty
are "chimeras and expressions of decline, of the final exhaustion of
life"]{.underline}** (A, 11**[). They make duty impersonal. Nietzsche
does not dismiss notions of duty and virtue but only suggests that they
must be personal discoveries. Regarding Kant, he says]{.underline}**:
Yet this nihilist with his Christian dogmatic entrails considered
pleasure an *objection*. **[What could destroy us more quickly than
working, thinking, and feeling without any inner necessity, without any
deeply personal choice, without pleasure---as an automaton of
"duty?"]{.underline}** (A,11)" **[For Nietzsche, the result of this is a
general weakening of the human personality.]{.underline}** Along similar
lines, Nietzsche takes Kant's aesthetics to lead to the same sort of
weakening of human personality. For Kant, Nietzsche quotes, the
beautiful is that "which gives us pleasure *without interest"* (GM,
III:6). Nietzsche is amused by this, writing, "If... one can *even* view
undraped female statues 'without interest,' one may laugh a little at
their expense" (*GM,* III:12). Nietzsche offers Stendhal's idea of
beauty as a contrast to Kant's disinterested aesthetic. Stendhal "calls
the beautiful *une promesse de Bonheur,"* which ought to "arouse the
will" (*GM,* III:6). In schopenhauer, Nietzsche finds a manifestation of
the Kantian aesthetic that brings its nihilism into clear light. Making
use of the Kantian notion of disinterested beauty, Schopenhauer finds
aesthetic contemplation to be "lupulin and camphor," a sort of
anesthesia for the will. Asking us to listen to its tone and sentiment,
Nietzsche quotes Schopenhauer: This is the painless condition that
Epicurus praised as the highest good and the condition of the gods; for
a moment we are delivered from the vile urgency of the will; we
celebrate the Sabbath of the penal servitude of volition, the wheel of
Ixion stands still! (*GM,* III:6)" Schopenhauer thought that the
beautiful should calm the will, and, by calming it, the human being can
find a degree of relief. Not far down the road from this point in
intellectual history is Nietzsche's "last man," who no longer desires
anything. **[To be sure, there is a difference between the last man and
the human being Kant envisioned as governed by the categorical
imperative. But insofar as Kant relegated the sphere of meaningfulness
to the sphere of the noumena, he made such a realm ultimately
unavailable. If such a person were to live according to the Kantian
worldview, with a high degree of honesty, he or she would resemble, as
Nietzsche writes, the German writer Heinrich von Kleist. In 1811, Kleist
committed suicide. His desire to live was diminished earlier when his
conviction that the world was meaningful, purposeful, and knowable was
shattered by Kant's epistemology.]{.underline}** Nietzsche writes in
*Schopenhauer as Educator* that **[Kleist suffered from a "despair of
truth" (*SE,* 3). This danger, he continues, "accompanies every thinker
whose starting point is Kantian philosophy"]{.underline}** (*SE,* 3).
**[Nietzsche then goes on to quote a letter from Kleist: A short while a
go... I became acquainted with Kant's philosophy---and I must now share
with you]{.underline}** one of his ideas, **[whereby I dare not fear
that it will shatter you as deeply and painfully as it did
me.]{.underline}** We cannot decide whether what we call truth is really
truth, or whether it only appears to us to be such. If the latter is the
case, then the truth we collect here is nothing upon our death. And all
our efforts to procure a possession that will follow us to the grave are
in vain... **[My sole, my supreme aim has disappeared, and I have no
other.]{.underline}** (*SE,* 3).

**White 97**\
(University of Illinois Press, *Nietzsche and the problem of
sovereignty)*

Kant's philosophy may have enabled the resurgence of tragic wisdom. But
it soon became clear to Nietzsche that while his own philosophy was also
concerned with the sovereignty of the individual, Kantian solutions,
like the categorical imperative, must entail the complete oblivion of
the individual as such. In The Antichrist, for example, **[Nietzsche
describes the categorical imperative as typical metaphysical ploy. He
views it as an attempt to escape or redeem individual existence by
directing it after a law that is both "universal" and "necessary." "The
fundamental laws of self-preservation and growth demand that everyone
invent his own virtue, his own categorical imperative," he writes.
"Nothing ruins us more profoundly, more intimately than every
'impersonal' duty, every sacrifice to the Moloch of
abstraction"]{.underline}** AC sec. 11). We might say that for Kant we
are only moral (and hence autonomous) agents insofar as we disregard the
particularities of space and time to consider ourselves the embodiment
of universal law. Arguing from the perspective of sovereignty,
**[Nietzsche asserts that the categorical imperative is therefore an
"immoral" concept since it suppresses the singularity of individual
existence within the monotonous rule of "law."]{.underline}** **[In
fact, Nietzsche realized that by reason by itself, or through the
meditation of the categorical imperative, may never be used to direct or
determine the nature of individual sovereignty. This conclusion is in
keeping with our basic understanding of what sovereignty means. If
sovereignty really is the celebration of the individual, or that mode of
being in which the individual achieves some kind of self-possession, the
legislation of any specific formula for sovereignty actually denies
individuality by attempting to order it in advance.]{.underline}** The
paradox here is that no one may simply "legislate" sovereignty, since
sovereignty is precisely the commandment one has over oneself. Thus, in
*Ecce Homo* Nietzsche celebrates his own life and the project of
self-appropriation, but he deliberately frustrates all imitation when he
warns about the danger of all books, or when he counters the heroic
portrayal of himself as the champion of impossible causes with a warning
to beware of all great poses(EH "Why I Am So Clever" sec. 10). Clearly,
he understood that to prescribe the specific content of sovereignty is
ipso facto to destroy it; and he was therefore bound to reject Kan's
circumspection of autonomy and sovereignty in the formula of the
categorical imperative. In the end, Nietzsche's criticism of Kant is
really a critique from within. For it is an attempt to radicalize Kant
that is still guided by the same sovereign ideal that is common to both
of them. And perhaps for this reason**[, Nietzsche's invective against
Kant is so relentless and impassioned; for in this way he empathizes the
essential difference between their retrospective projects. In fact,
Nietzsche's meditation on Kant's doctrine of sovereignty suggests the
paradoxical nature of Nietzsche own philosophical goal. In all of the
passages quoted above, Nietzsche criticizes Kant because the latter has
abandoned the individual to the rule of the impersonal law. Clearly,
Nietzsche's goal is somehow to rescue individuals from whatever values,
institutions, or moralities constrain them and encoureage
self-oblivion]{.underline}**. But if sovereignty is to be identified
with the affirmation of the individual as such, then it follows that
sovereignty can never be conceptually appropriated; the individual is
that which cannot be analyzed, reduced, or repeated in language:
*individuum ineffabile est*. In this sense, however, a "philosophy of
sovereignty" is bound to express that which can never be said. Hence it
must remain deeply problematic and will require every kind of ruse and
strategy if it is ever to succeed.

human security does,**]{.underline} whether broad or narrow, [**is to
help define the exceptional circumstances that require the international
community's intervention**, **whether on behalf of humanitarian
imperatives**]{.underline} as initially conceived or in the service of
maintaining global order as made evident more recently. **[It does so by
initially constructing the terms that inform the exceptional
circumstances that define the range of threats to human
life]{.underline}**. In turn[, **it contributes to the labour of
defining and authorizing when the suspension of conventional
international law of nations can occur**]{.underline}**.** The question
that surfaces at this juncture is what authorizes the suspension of the
law in the name of human security when the discourse of human security
has yet to find its codification as international law? In other words,
what allows human security to stand *before* the law? Returning to
Agamben, human security can be understood here as participating in the
institution of a form of sovereign power insofar as it simultaneously
operates within and outside the law. It points towards a zone of
indistinction in relation to its efforts to codify the authorization of
a form of international intervention that becomes apparent in the fact
that this authorization has yet to receive the status of international
law while, at the same time, it must invoke the force that law normally
assumes. The human security discourse thus finds itself in an *aporia*
in relation to international law, which it must suspend while
simultaneously invoking its force. On this point, Agamben's reading of
the relationship between sovereign power and biopower clearly brings
back an element of analysis that is intentionally left aside in
Foucault's biopoliticization of sovereign power highlighted through his
reading of racism noted earlier. Agamben allows us to reintroduce the
connection between the institution of the juridico-political order and
biopower, which much of Foucault's work on modern forms of power 'under
the rubric of a multiplicity of force relations' sought to sever (Neal,
2004: 375). Having said that, Agamben's reading is not entirely
satisfactory either, which leads us to the final element of the
assemblage between sovereign power and biopower brought to light by the
human security discourse. Following Connolly's critique noted earlier,
Agamben appears to maintain a view of the logic and paradox of sovereign
power as coherent and ultimately centred on the sovereignty of the
state. The cartography of the form of sovereign power that articulates
itself through the human security discourse would seem to complicate
this view. **[Human security can be read as informing the institution of
a form of sovereign power that ultimately has as its plane of exercise
the globe. This element of globality emerges most clearly in the manner
in which the human security discourse articulates threats. Constituting
threats specifically in terms of threats to human life means that the
human security discourse, through a categorization and accounting of
such threats, must constitute them with a view of (in)security that is
global.]{.underline}** In conceptual terms, **[viewing human life as a
grounds upon which the (in)security dilemma is played out makes the life
of the human species the referent of security]{.underline}** (Dillon,
2007). To be sure, the **[human security discourse in practice
identifies these threats as emanating from specific locales insofar as
its interventions target delimited non-Western populations, and thus the
Western state clearly continues to play a central role in mounting the
recent series of international interventions]{.underline}**. However,
too much emphasis on the state misses how such interventions have come
to depend upon 'strategic complexes' of global governance that bring
together 'state and non-state actors, public and private organizations,
military and civilian organisations' (Duffield, 2001: 45[)**. In helping
to constitute key elements of the state of exception, the human security
discourse prepares the conceptual ground upon which such complexes are
bound up with instituting a form of global sovereign power unmoored from
the formal juridico-political sovereignty of any one state or coalition
of states**]{.underline}. Within the post-9/11 moment, then, **[human
security can be seen as having laid the conceptual terrain for a form of
human subjectivity amenable to the exercise of global sovereign
rule]{.underline}**. Rather than seeing a disjuncture between pre- and
post-9/11, human security proposes a form of life that is intimately
connected to the assemblages of biopower and sovereign power that mark
this rule.

This article has sought to explore the interconnections between biopower
and sovereign power in relation to the human security discourse. An
entry point into understanding factors contributing to such an
assemblage is to be found precisely in the shifting conceptions of
security in the postwar period. In this frame, the circulatory dynamics
become the new grounds upon which to understand global order in terms of
security. From here, **[the broadening and deepening of security can be
traced to the apprehension of irremediable threats at a global
level]{.underline}**. It is from this general context that we can
comprehend the advent of the human security discourse in both its broad
and narrow forms. While the human security discourse draws from the
transformations of security in the postwar environment, it also, we
argued, moves towards new terrain. Most notably, it casts the
problematique of (in)security in biopolitical terms by having the health
and welfare of populations as its referent. **[Much of the initial work
of the human security discourse has been about properly ordering,
categorizing and accounting for the 'true' threats to human
life]{.underline}**. More recently, the formalization and
institutionalization of the human security discourse within the UN has
begun to locate areas of strategic intervention that, informed by
rationalities of governmentality, are meant to minimize risks by
distinguishing between 'good' and 'bad' circulation. In the post-9/11
era, we identify continuity rather than rupture in the human security
discourse. **[While many would see the humanitarian impulse within the
human security discourse as anathema to emerging patterns of world order
signed by the 'global war on terrorism', we make the argument that, in
rendering life in biopolitical terms, this discourse in fact prepares
the ground for the operation of a form of sovereign power that claims
the globe as its field of operation]{.underline}.** What an
institutional examination of the human security discourse affords us is
a way in which we can trace the assemblage of sovereign power and
biopower in the contemporary moment while concurrently revealing a
complexity to this articulation that escapes its more formal
theorization. **[In rendering life bare and politically unqualified,
human security enables a form of human subjectivity amenable to the sway
of sovereign power exercised from the global realm]{.underline}**.
Moreover, we argue that the human security discourse is intimately bound
with the problematique of exceptionality, and thus participates in
providing the ground for the justification of suspending founding
elements of international law while simultaneously seeking the force
that law must entail in order to authorize a new form of international
intervention. Finally, we suggest that **[this production of human
subjectivity that the human security discourse participates in enabling,
coupled with the logic of exceptionality in the post-9/11 moment, can be
understood as providing the grounds for an exercise of sovereign power
on a planetary scale.]{.underline}**

## The State's attempt to be ethical is just a cover to increase biopolitical control over the population.

**[During the 1990s, the concept of human security circulating among
academics, governments, policy institutes, nongovernmental
organizations, intergovernmental bodies and the media became
increasingly influential in narrating the changing patterns of world
order and prescribing action within them. Meant to figure the shifting
source and meaning of threats, human security coincided with the broader
labour of redefining traditional notions of national
security]{.underline}** that had begun in the 1970s but intensified with
the collapse of the Cold War. Although the discursive economy of human
security tended to be divided between strong notions (emphasizing
threats such as famine, hunger, disease and economic crisis) and narrow
readings (focusing on violence, state failure, civil war, crimes against
humanity and genocide[), **the common thread that tied the discourse
together was the emphasis on shifting the referent from the state to the
individual and, thus, bringing security down to the lives of human
beings**.]{.underline} In so doing, **[the discursive economy of human
security not only sought to unravel the notion of security from statism
and the interstate system, but also attempted to couple security with
the concerns of international humanitarianism and human
development]{.underline}.** The responses to world order marked by the
events of 9/11 seem to have created two positions with regards to the
present and future of the concept of human security.1 On the one hand,
there are those who would argue that 9/11 sounded the death knell of the
human security discourse**.** The military actions and the
counter-insurgency campaigns waged in various parts of the globe that
sign the 'global war on terror' would suggest a violent and brutal
return to the discourse of traditional state-centric security and the
concomitant collapse of the vaunted New World Order foretold in the
early 1990s from which the notion of human security emerged. **[From
unsanctioned, preemptive military actions against harbouring states and
rogue states and targeted military operations to support the 'war on
terror', to extralegal detention centres, state-sponsored
assassinations, 'extraordinary rendition', deportation without due
process, suspension of habeas corpus and indefinite detention, the
contemporary moment certainly does not seem to leave much space for
governance with a 'human face'.]{.underline}** On the other hand, for
others, while the policies and actions unleashed by the 'global war on
terror' certainly appear to mark a setback in the form of world order
that is necessary for the continued implementation of human security,
9/11 served as a stark reminder of the kinds of socio-economic
conditions that the broader human security discourse was meant to
remedy. Advocates would point to **[the continued institutionalization
of this discourse within the]{.underline}** United Nations as evidence
that the unilateral measures of the [**United States do not obviate the
need for, and have not mitigated the continued articulation of policies
and practices aimed at, the development of a more humane form of global
governance.**]{.underline} This article argues that both possible
responses leave unattended the manner in which the human security
discourse works towards setting the terrain for the transition from the
pre- to the post-9/11 world order. **[The initial humanitarian
imperatives that drive the discussions surrounding the need to bring
greater security to human lives help to constitute a form of life
amenable to an exercise of the form of sovereign power that has marked
the post-9/11 era]{.underline}**. This article traces this alternative
reading by illustrating how **[the concept of human security can be read
as working to set the discursive terrain for the dual exercise of
sovereign power and biopower]{.underline}**. Using the work of Michel
Foucault and Giorgio Agamben, we outline this duality by examining not
only how the human security discourse participates in defining the
conditions of exceptionality, thus enabling the exercise of sovereign
power, but also how[**, in having human life as its target, human
security ultimately enacts the human in biopolitical
terms**.]{.underline} Seen from this vantage point, **[the concept of
human security informs the current biopolitical networks of global
governmentalities and works in conjunction with -- rather than against
-- the exercise of sovereign power made evident by the 'global war on
terrorism']{.underline}**. The article also seeks to turn the discussion
towards theory by bringing to light how our reading of the conceptual
deployment of human security from the vantage point of the international
leads to assemblages of sovereign power and biopower unanticipated by
the theoretical articulations offered by Foucault and Agamben. Our
initial aim is to examine what, at first sight, may appear as two
competing modalities of power -- that is, sovereign power and biopower.
We then turn to the concept of security with regards to the conditions
of possibility for the development of the human security discourse in
the post-Cold War world. This sets the stage for our examination of
human security. Here, our objective is twofold: (a) to interpret the
concept of human security through biopower and sovereign power, as noted
above, and (b), conversely, to **[use the human security discourse as a
vantage point from which to read the way in which these technologies of
power can be seen as interwoven in ways not made evident by their
theoretical articulation.]{.underline}**

## The idea of human rights and a state's obligation to protect things like hunger is just the moving of security discourse into the private life.

What we propose below is an examination of the complementarity between
sovereign power and biopower via the concept of human security as it has
been articulated from the realm of the international, while concurrently
revealing how the human security discourse itself provides a way of
tracing some of the complexity highlighted above, thus problematizing
the more formal and theoretical assemblage of sovereign power and
biopower found in the work of Foucault and Agamben. In order to place
this analysis in context, we begin by tracing the discourse of security
from the post-World War II context onward. What we intend to show is
that the shift from the term 'defence' to 'security' helps set the
terrain from which the interweaving of biopower and sovereign power
found in the concept of human security is rendered possible. The formal
origins of the concept of human security are to be found in the
worldview of an international organization that was concerned with post-
Cold War humanitarian issues, and only subsequently became enmeshed in
the discourse of national foreign policy concerns and academic debates
on security. Generally attributed to the 1994 UNDP Human Development
Report and some of the concurrent writings of Mahbub ul-Haq[, **the
initial impulse was to shift the referent from the state to the
'legitimate concerns of ordinary people who s\[eek\] security in their
daily lives**]{.underline}**'** (UNDP, 1994: 22). In other words[, **the
objective was to bring security down to the level of human life by
seeking to develop strategies in the provision of both 'safety from such
chronic threats as hunger, disease and repression' and 'protection from
sudden and hurtful disruptions in the patterns of daily life -- whether
in homes and jobs or in communities**']{.underline} (UNDP, 1994: 23). In
so doing, **[security was to be decoupled from the particular national
interest of states and tied to the 'universal
concern\[s\]']{.underline}** (UNDP, 1994: 22) **[of all
people.]{.underline}** In articulating itself universally, **[human
security was therefore initially meant to be built upon the bedrock of
universal human rights]{.underline}.** **[This move would be accompanied
by efforts to identify a comprehensive list of threats that the 'all
encompassing' (UNDP, 1994: 24) concept of human security would respond
to -- that is, economic, food, health, environmental, personal,
community and political security]{.underline}** (UNDP, 1994: 24--25).
Clear connections were made between severe impediments to human
development and pervasive and chronic threats to the fulfilment of human
potential. Such a broad formulation sought to transcend the state,
insofar as it brought into question its role as a provider of security
relative to other actors -- for example, international organizations,
NGOs and non-military government agencies -- while simultaneously
identifying the state itself as a potential source of insecurity. This
elision of the state also served to make the quotidian the object of
security[.]{.underline} Whereas security tended to be understood in
terms of defining historical moments centred around the survival and
integrity of the state[,]{.underline} we now see emerging an
understanding of (in)security that 'arises more from worries about daily
life than from the dread of a cataclysmic world event' (UNDP, 1994: 22).
In this way, human security certainly participated in the broader
redefinition of security begun in the 1970s and 1980s; however, it also
set off on new terrain, in that shifting its referent to the individual
introduces as threats a host of contingencies that emerge from daily
life. This initial deployment of the concept in the mid-1990s was
subsequently accompanied by other efforts to theorize human security in
ways that would be more amenable to the multilateral and middle-power
approaches found in the foreign policy concerns of certain states.
**[Examples like the *Responsibility* *To Protect* generally moved away
from the broader development concerns of the Human Development Report
towards a more narrow focus on introducing a new set of international
norms on intervention that would guide and restrict the conduct of the
state and the international community in 'extreme and exceptional
cases']{.underline}** (ICISS, 2001: 31). Here, **[the threats are
concomitantly narrowed down to 'violent threats to individuals'
(]{.underline}**Human Security Center, 2005: viii), **[such as 'mass
murder and rape, ethnic cleansing by forcible expulsion and terror, and
deliberate starvation and exposure to disease']{.underline}** (United
Nations, 2004: 65). Emphasis shifts from an understanding of threats
that stem from a broad set of quotidian political, social, economic and
environmental contingencies, to what are deemed to be 'avoidable
catastrophe\[s\]' (United Nations, 2004: 65). Within this context, there
is a partial but significant return to the state, in that it is through
the nexus of the state that the provision of both security and
insecurity, by state and non-state actors, is predominantly understood.

**[The traditional apparatus of the state as concerns its monopoly over
the (il)legitimate use of violence also makes its return in the form of
military intervention as a response of last resort to the extreme
violation of rights that are held as inviolable. This then enables the
shift towards tying security to the notion of the state's ability or
inability to fulfil its responsibility to protect the human beings
within its care.]{.underline}** In this sense, **[the referent and
threats continue to be articulated in non-territorial forms, as within
the broader notion of human security, but the responses are framed
within the nexus of the state and therefore call forth a statist
conception of security]{.underline}. [This return to the state is made
all the more evident in the manner in which the narrower concept of
human security centres around (re)defining norms]{.underline}**
surrounding the legitimacy of the international community's right to
intervention. **[Such an effort attempts to inaugurate and codify a new
law around a set of norms that simultaneously requires the suspension of
certain foundational elements of international law in 'cases of violence
which so genuinely "shock the conscience of mankind", or which present
such a clear and present danger to international security, that they
require coercive military intervention']{.underline}** (ICISS, 2001: 31)
on the part of the international community. It is the concept of human
security that serves to define and identify the extreme and exceptional
circumstances that it itself requires in the subsequent formulation of
its responses. In so doing, **[the human security discourse participates
in setting the conditions for both the suspension of the law and the
authorization of its refounding in the form of new norms of
intervention]{.underline}**. As we will explore below, this [**marks a
key dimension of the operation of the concept of sovereign
power**]{.underline} elaborated earlier. The bulk of the most current
stage of the development of the human security discourse can be found in
the institutionalization of that discourse within the UN, beginning with
the 2004 report by the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and
Change (United Nations, 2004), the UN Secretary-General's 2005 report
*In Larger Freedom* (United Nations, 2005a), the General Assembly's
World Summit Outcome Document in September 2005 (United Nations, 2005b),
and UN Security Council Resolutions 1674 and 1706, adopted in April and
August of 2006, respectively. These documents which set the stage for
the formalization of the human security discourse within the UN via its
two main bodies.10 In parallel with these developments, the independent
Advisory Board on Human Security and the Human Security Unit (HSU)
within the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)
were created in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Both were fashioned as a
result of the recommendations formulated in the Human Security
Commission's (2003) report *Human Security Now*, and both were charged
with disseminating and integrating human security within the UN and
beyond. These activities have been financed by the UN Trust Fund for
Human Security (UNTFHS), set up by the government of Japan, which also
sponsored the establishment of the Commission.11 The Human Security Unit
reports that an average of 24 projects have been funded per year since
2004. While these developments are recent and cannot be overstated given
the chill that 9/11 brought to the debates on international humanitarian
intervention, they do however indicate an attempt at mainstreaming the
concept of human security through a process of initiating formalization
and institutionalization. What follows is a reading of the broad and
narrow conceptions of human security informed by our earlier elaboration
of the concepts of sovereign power and biopower.

## The ability of the state to apply good or bad ethical claims is the root of security discourse. In the name of ethics the affirmative gives the state increased biopolitical control. {#the-ability-of-the-state-to-apply-good-or-bad-ethical-claims-is-the-root-of-security-discourse.-in-the-name-of-ethics-the-affirmative-gives-the-state-increased-biopolitical-control. .Tags}

**[In (re)defining the threats to human life as its most basic
operation, the discourse of human security must begin by defining and
enacting the human in biopolitical terms. The target of human security,
whether broad or narrow, is to make live the life of the individual
through a complex of strategies initiated at the level of populations.
In defining and responding to threats to human life, these strategies
have as their aim the avoidance of risk and the management of
contingency in the overall goal of improving the life lived by the
subjects invoked in their own operation]{.underline}**. In this sense,
as with Foucault's understanding of the biopolitical, the health and
welfare of populations is human security's frame of intervention;
however, until its recent institutionalization within the UN[**, the
human security discourse**,]{.underline} from the vantage point of the
international**[, has been marked mostly by defining and identifying the
global patterns and trends of human *in*security]{.underline}**. In
other words**[, the human security discourse's initial move is found in
creating the measurements that aggregate the threats to human
life]{.underline}**. The clearest example of this initial labour in
relation to the narrower understanding of human security can be found in
the Human Security Report in 2005, which boasts that 'no annual
publication maps the trends in the incidence, severity, causes and
consequences of global violence as comprehensively' (Human Security
Centre, 2005: viii). This quest to properly order, categorize and
account for the 'true' threats to human life in the post-Cold War world
is also exemplified in the series of UNDP reports. As Mark Duffield &
Nicholas Waddell (2006: 5) point out, 'the UNDP . . . launched its
annual *Human Development Report* in 1990, dedicating it to ". . .
ending the mismeasure of human progress by economic growth alone"'[.
**It is through this mapping that the human security discourse then
advocates on behalf of specific areas of strategic intervention in the
name of the health and welfare of targeted populations**.]{.underline}
Although still in their infancy, **[the strategies are meant to foster
development as a means of securing the health and welfare of targeted
populations]{.underline}**. Recent programmes detailed by the Human
Security Unit include preventing the abuse of illicit drugs in
Afghanistan; addressing the health of women and adolescents affected by
HIV in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala; contributing to the
provision of more secure access to small-scale energy services for local
basic necessities in Senegal, Burkina Faso, Ghana and Guinea; combating
the trafficking of women and children in Cambodia and Vietnam; providing
access to education in Kosovo; integrating displaced peoples in
Colombia; promoting the radio broadcasting of information covering
humanitarian issues in areas of Africa and Afghanistan; building civic
participation and self-reliance in Timor-Leste; and stabilizing refugee
host communities through a multifaceted strategy that includes the
reduction of small arms and the provision of basic education, food and
environmental security in Tanzania (United Nations Human Security Unit,
2006). Such programmes operate at the level of the chronic insecurities
in the day-to-day life of targeted populations. They envision human
security as part of 'comprehensive, integrated, people-centered
solutions' (United Nations Human Security Unit, 2006: 2) that are meant
to provide a measure of remedy to quotidian threats[.]{.underline} While
the programmes target specific populations in delimited locales, **[the
threats are themselves framed in regards to circulation and seek to
ultimately distinguish the bad from the good flows in terms of
(in)security]{.underline}**. In this scenario, following from the
programme examples above, '**[good circulation' would include
information on humanitarian issues, civic participation and
self-reliance; 'bad circulation' would entail, inter alia, trafficking,
illicit drugs and small arms.]{.underline}** Returning to Foucault's
understanding of security and circulation elaborated earlier, **[the
frame of intervention of the human security discourse, in seeking to
maximize the positive elements and minimize the risks to human life,
operates on a terrain of calculability that attempts to manage the
incalculable through probabilities.]{.underline}** In its initial
stages, **[the objective of the human security discourse, in seeking to
distinguish between bad and good circulation, had as its primary grammar
of reference sustainable human development]{.underline}**.12 With the
post-9/11 moment and the ensuing 'war on terror', however, the
distinction between good and bad circulation tends to take as its frame
of reference global order. With the attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon, as well as the subsequent bombings in Madrid and
London, the globality of the circulation of threats for the 'West'
becomes more explicit, and consequently a new cartography of threats and
vulnerabilities is drawn up and rationalities and technologies are
deployed to counter them. As Duffield & Waddell (2006: 10) explain in
relation to the 'war on terrorism': **[The predominance of security
concerns, especially homeland security, means that issuesof global
circulation -- of people, weapons, networks, illicit commodities, money,
information, and so on -- emanating from, and flowing through the
world's conflict zones, now influence the consolidating biopolitical
function of development]{.underline}**. Unlike Duffield & Waddell's
work, **[the tack we would like to follow in the section below is not
directed towards tracing the biopolitical function of international
development practices in relation to the 'war on terror', but to the way
in which the human security discourse participates in setting the
terrain for and the deployment of sovereign power.]{.underline}**

## In the name of humanitarian and ethical concerns the government intervenes even more into the person life of the people. The biopolitical order is reinforced by the idea that the state has a responsibility to its people and therefore has a right to control it. {#in-the-name-of-humanitarian-and-ethical-concerns-the-government-intervenes-even-more-into-the-person-life-of-the-people.-the-biopolitical-order-is-reinforced-by-the-idea-that-the-state-has-a-responsibility-to-its-people-and-therefore-has-a-right-to-control-it. .Tags}

One would be hard pressed to find a more paradigmatic symbol of the
post- 9/11 world order than Camp Delta. **[Guantánamo Bay has become the
prime example through which the question of exceptionalism and its
bounded relationship to sovereignty has come to the
for]{.underline}e**.13 How is it possible to reconcile the biopolitical
function of human security outlined above with the exceptional times of
the post-9/11 world? What are the mechanisms and assemblages through
which we can understand the complementarity between biopower and
sovereign power? In this final section, we explore what we understand to
be two key dimensions that mark the complementarity between these forms
of power while simultaneously showing how their articulation
problematizes the way in which they have been understood in theoretical
terms. We have already explored via Agamben's work how rendering life
bare can be seen as the originary activity of sovereign power. What can
be brought to light here, in relation to our discussion of human
security above, is that the life lived by the subjects of the human
security discourse can be seen as life lived as 'bare' inasmuch as this
discourse is not meant to qualify political life. As explored
previously, life through the lens of human security is understood
primarily in terms of providing for the basic sustenance of day-to-day
life. [**Brought into the post-9/11 context, what this enables is an
opening towards mapping global order in a way that apportions this bare
life in relation to zones of exceptionality amenable to the logic of an
exercise of sovereign power. This is reflected in the way development
objectives and humanitarian goals now tend to submit more directly to
the dictates of the management of global order**. Instead of targeting
**populations that are most insecure as measured by the human security
discourse and viewing the provision of security to those populations as
an end in itself, the targeting is now overridden by the hard security
concerns of homelands and ends understood increasingly in terms of the
aims of the 'global war on terror**]{.underline}**'**.14 While the human
security discourse could always be critically interpreted as
prioritizing its responses to populations that are threatened in
relation to servicing the maintenance of the global liberal order
(Chandler, 2004), **[the shift here can be understood as one where this
servicing reveals a more intimate connection between sovereign power,
biopolitics and the maintenance of post- 9/11 order.]{.underline}** This
connection comes in the way in which the human security discourse
prepares conceptually a form of life that is at hand for the mounting of
proactive interventions of pre-emption and prevention. We can see
elements of this shift in the most recent institutional developments of
the human security discourse within the UN. To be certain, **[the post-
9/11 moment can be taken as a movement away from a further codification
of grounds for humanitarian intervention that would have as its
objective the health and welfare of populations as an end in
itself]{.underline}**. As Alex Bellamy (2006: 165) chronicles, **[the
language of the World Summit Outcome Document as it relates to the model
of humanitarian intervention outlined in the 2001 ICISS report was
watered down in favour of reinforcing not only the principle that the
burden of protecting populations fell chiefly on individual states, but
also the idea that the threshold for interventions on humanitarian
grounds should be high]{.underline}**. Thus, **[there was a clear shift
in the document away from what was meant to be shared responsibility
between the international community and the host state through a
re-emphasis of the responsibility of the latter]{.underline}**. At the
same time, the document also moved towards safeguarding the Security
Council's political discretion to choose when and whether it would
intervene rather than endorsing binding criteria that would compel the
Council to act in cases of clear humanitarian emergencies, as prescribed
in the ICISS report (Bellamy, 2006: 166--167). While **[these
changes]{.underline}** can be seen as weakening the case for binding the
Council to intervene on humanitarian grounds, they **[can also be read
as broadening the scope for interventions on discretionary
grounds.]{.underline}** They do this by further codifying the range of
justifications for intervention that emerged from Security Council
resolutions during the 1990s while simultaneously reaffirming the
Council's ability to choose which cases merit its attention. Perhaps
most **[importantly, the outcome document retains the understanding of
sovereignty as responsibility outlined in the ICISS report, reinforcing
the notion that it is the host state that has the primary responsibility
to protect. The test of responsibility here remains couched in terms of
the biopolitical functions of the state insofar as what is measured is
the latter's ability or inability to provide for the health
and]{.underline} [welfare of the populations within its
care]{.underline}.** As recounted by Bellamy (2006:
164--167[),]{.underline} the negotiations leading to the final draft of
the outcome document came as a result of pressure from representatives
of states that wanted either a free hand to determine whether and when
to intervene (the USA) or to retain the traditional supremacy of
sovereignty in terms of political and legal autonomy (Russia and China).
Although this can be taken as a deferral to the norms of territorial
inviolability, **[there is a continued adherence to an understanding of
sovereignty that is qualified in line with the state's biopolitical
functions, in that 'each individual State has the responsibility to
protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and
crimes against humanity]{.underline}'** (United Nations, 2005b: para.
138). Combined with the endorsement of the Security Council's political
discretion on intervention, **[these most recent institutional
developments could also be read as a codification of sovereignty in
biopolitical terms, and thus as reinforcing the linkages between
sovereign power and biopower.]{.underline}**

## Foundationalism is a moral stance that leads towards a homogenous biopolitical structure {#foundationalism-is-a-moral-stance-that-leads-towards-a-homogenous-biopolitical-structure .Tags}

Jeffrey Minson 1985\
Genealogies of Morals: Nietzsche, Foucault, Donzelot and the
Eccentricity of Ethics

**[*Foundationalism* we define abstractly as follows. It views ethical
considerations as always grounding, and therefore ideally overriding
other considerations. The ethical cannot be confined to other province
of human and social life but rather subsumes all other provinces. This
subsumption consists in always being entitled to subject economic,
political, artistic, legal or any other aspects of situation to its
criteria of evaluations]{.underline}**. Moral evaluations takes priority
over other particularistic and consequently one-sided types of
evaluations; these themselves lie under an injunction to attempt to take
their cue from the ethic mode of evaluations which transcends them all.
**[Evaluations takes the form of subjecting actions or state of affairs
to the test of whether they conform to the first principles of that
ethic]{.underline}**. To take a well-known example from eighteenth
century political philosophy, Jeremy Bentham's *Fragment on Government*
advertised the merits of the principle of utility as the 'rock' on which
all rationally justifiable Parliamentary legislation and social
administration must be grounded: '... accurately apprehended and
steadily applied (the principle of utility) affords the only clue to
guide a man through these straits' (Bentham 1967, pp. 93, 97).
**[However, philosophical theories hold no monopoly on this form of
argument]{.underline}**. Anticipating the case-study on abortion in
Chapter 8 below, it is on the basis of ethical foundationalism that
people view abortion as primarily a moral issue, the questionable
corollary of this view being that principled abortion law and policy
must flow from a prior consideration of its moral justifibiability.
Foundationalism is never a purely ethical stance; over and above
principles of evaluations or justification, it always embodies a view
(if not in explicit empirical propositions, then in its metaphors,
imagery and rhetoric) about its moral constituency i.e. the nature of
the agents who are subjected to its constraints. When Mary Midgley seeks
to base her ethics on universal human needs, she neglects to take
account of the extent to which the ethical **[foundationalism framework
orders the space in which these universal human attributes can appear as
the prior and ethically decisive one. Foundationalism's mode of
evaluation conveys two implications in respect to change: (i) if
something is morally wrong, therefore we ought to move heaven and earth
to change it; and (ii) an imperialist impulse towards homogenization,
i.e. an urge to remould the whole world in the ideal image of its first
principles. For these reasons foundationalism may be singled out as the
single most important key to the enigma of the so-called eccentricity of
ethics]{.underline}** which was first broached in the preface.

**[Contemporary Western societies are]{.underline}** not only societies
of the tree; they are **[also societies of the state form. Since it is
impossible to do justice to this concept here, I will restrict the
discussion to the couplet war-machine/state form,]{.underline}** and the
relations of this couplet with the arborescent/rhizomatic distinction.
**[State forms, at the highest level of generality, are apparatuses of
capture that bring 'outside' elements 'inside' by connecting them up
with an arborescent syste]{.underline}**m. While Deleuze and Guattari do
provide elements of a genealogy (1986: 424--37), they are careful to
point out that the state form cannot be traced back to a point of
origin. Rather, 'there have been states always and everywhere' (429),
coexisting in relations of competition and cooperation with
war-machines, forces that are exterior to the state apparatus and
attempt to 'untie the bonds' of capture (352), to 'destroy the State and
its subjects' (Deleuze and Parnet, 1983: 104). In terms of social and
political effects, states tend to perpetuate already instantiated
(arborescent) forms, while war-machines tend to destroy old forms and
instantiate new ones through rhizomatic connections. Thus, for Deleuze
and Guattari, 'revolutionary organization must be that of the war
machine and not of state apparatus' (Guattari, 1995: 66); indeed, they
see their own writing as an operation that 'weds a war machine and lines
of flight, abandoning . . . the State apparatus' (Deleuze and Guattari,
1986: 24). Yet, just as arborescent forms can grow rhizomatic
appendages, states can -- and must -- incorporate warmachines, tame them
and put them to use in 'an institutionalized army', make them part of
the 'general police' function (Deleuze and Parnet, 1983: 103). This is
the 'special danger' of the war-machine: if it does not succeed in
warding off the development of a state form, it must pass into the
service of the state or destroy *itself* (104). It is here, in the form
of ecstatic injunctions accompanied by somber warnings, that Deleuze and
Guattari, like Foucault, present not only a 'negative' call to
resistance, but also a consistent and 'positive' ethicopolitical stance.
At times, they take us even further than this, advocating what Keith
Ansell-Pearson has called 'novel images of positive social relations'
(Ansell-Pearson, 1998: 410). Thus Deleuze: '**[We have no need to
totalize that which is invariably totalized on the side of \[dead\]
power; if we were to move in this direction, it would mean restoring the
representative forms of centralism and a hierarchical structure. We must
set up lateral affiliations and an entire system of networks and popular
bases']{.underline}** (Foucault, 1996: 78). This system of networks and
popular bases, organized along rhizomatic lines and actively warding off
the development of arborescent structures, **[would provide bases for
social forces that neither ask for gifts from the state]{.underline}**
(as in the liberal-democratic new social movements) **[nor seek state
power themselves]{.underline}** (as in classical Marxism). **[Unlike the
molar forms of social transformation, these molecular movements would
resist the will to domination in Foucault's sense, in favour of
affinity; that is, they would take up ethico-political positions but
refuse to try *coercively to generalize* these positions by making
moral, ontological, or other foundational claims.]{.underline}**

Ecological Crisis: The Authoritarian Challenge to Liberalism"

Essays on the ecological crisis usually stress the point that resources
are finite. The conditions that make life possible are being threatened
by overpopulation and by industrial processes which deplete resources
and pollute air and water. Typically, the crisis is considered the
result of in- creasing shortages in the physical environment. However, a
more complete understanding of the ecological crisis requires an
examination of human nature, especially as it has been reflected in and
shaped by modern political thought since the Renaissance. Modern
political thought, in a departure from classical modes of reasoning,
emphasized secularism, materialism, individualism, and individual
rights-the cornerstones of the political ideology of liberalism and the
foundation of the American political system. The resulting view of
man\'s relations to his fellow man and to the physical environment makes
solutions to the ecological crisis particularly difficult in the United
States because, contrary to the liberal ideology and political
institutions so long enjoyed here, **solutions will require constraints
on individual and group behavior**. The radical departure of modern
political philosophy from the classical tradition becomes apparent on
recalling Plato\'s Republic, in which Socrates and the interlocutors
sought to discover the meaning of justice as it appeared in the soul and
in the city. Their dialetical search for a just \"City in Speech\"-a
hypothetical city-led them first to the simple city which provided for
man\'s basic needs. It was well ordered but assured adequate provisions
for only the necessities of life. Though Socrates called it the city
healthy, Glaucon called it a \"city of pigs,\" for it failed to satisfy
man\'s desire for those comforts and conveniences which go far beyond
life\'s necessities. This point forced the interlocutors to continue the
search for the City in Speech, examining not only the requirements of
justice but the nature of human desires and the source of proper limits
for the soul and the city.\' Creation of the just City in Speech
reflected the ancient understanding that human beings must control their
desires, and the discovery and implementation of proper controls, said
Socrates, required rule by philosophers. In order for the City in Speech
to come into being, philosophers would have to become kings or vice
versa. But since chances of wisdom coinciding with consent were slight,
Socrates completed the dialogue by showing how the City in Speech could
degenerate because of the triumph of governing principles other than
wisdom. The City in Speech was left to stand only as a standard by which
to evaluate actual political communities. Its creation in the dialogue,
however, exposed enduring political problems, among them how to control
human desires for material comforts and conveniences. The classical
tradition assumed that part of the art of governing was the control of
such desires.2 In many ways modern political philosophy stood this
classical tradition on its head by emphasizing popular consent rather
than philosophic wisdom as a major goal of politics. Individual rights
and liberties became the source of limits on governmental authority.
Government came to be understood as originating from a contract agreed
to by autonomous individuals. And the pursuit of happiness became
largely a pursuit of material goods for which there were no natural
limits. This modern political philosophy has nurtured the liberal
tradition in America. One of the major accomplishments of the Founders
was creation of a political system that legitimized the pursuit of
material comforts, that thinkers in the classical tradition had sought
to harness. However, the success of the Founders\' experiment in liberal
government depended on the infinite availability of the natural
resources necessary for such pursuits. Contemporary discovery of the
earth\'s \"carrying capacity,\" or lim- its to nature\'s \"commons,\"
appears to jeopardize the continued success of the American experiment.
**If American political ideology and institutions have been successful
in encouraging pursuit of happiness through material acquisition, they
appear incapable of imposing the limits which are required to forestall
ecological disaster**. This incapability, in turn, leads to arguments
that popular government must give way to authoritarianism. But if
authoritarianism is the response to the inability of popular government
to impose the limits required to avoid ecological disaster, such a
response merely reflects the crisis to which modern political philosophy
and liberalism have led; it is not itself a solution. There is no
assurance that authoritarianism is any more capable of proper limits
than is popular government. Perhaps the best illumination of the dilemma
posed by the ecological crisis is a review of the philosophy of John
Locke, whose thought profoundly influenced the Founders of the American
republic.

[Lockean thought legitimated virtually endless accumulation of material
goods; helped equate the process of accumulation with liberty and the
pursuit of happiness; helped implant the idea that with ingenuity man
can go beyond the fixed laws of nature, adhering only to whatever
temporary laws he establishes for himself in the process of pursuing
happiness; and helped instill the notion that the \"commons\" is served
best through each man\'s pursuit of private gain, because there will
always be enough for all who are willing to work]{.underline}. In short,
[Lockean philosophy led to a strong ideology of man\'s relationship to
man and the earth, in which autonomous individuals seek comfort and
enjoyment through hard work and material acquisitions. Such beliefs,
added to the doctrine of inalien- able rights and the argument of
limited government, have played a significant role in the design of the
American Constitution and political]{.underline}

Less than forty years after the adoption of the Constitution, Alexis de
Tocqueville observed that in America, \"Nothing checks the spirit of
enterprise[.]{.underline}\" He noted that the enjoyment of liberty could
not be separated from the \"productive industry\" fostered by free
enterprise.14 The dream of life lived for the enjoyment of liberty
(freedom to pursue abundance through productive enterprise) and
happiness (the securing of abun- dance) appeared to be coming true.
Nothing in the constitutional structure threatened the dream, and it was
increasingly clear that government in the United States existed to
secure the blessings of property, just as Locke had taught. By the
nineteenth century the radically secular orientation of American
liberalism was bolstered by developments in modern natural science.15
Scientific advances provided new insights into the workings of the
physical environment and ways to control it. Technology and industrial-
ism provided seemingly unlimited opportunities to create the material
abundance associated with happiness. Liberalism, argues Louis Hartz,
proved its real strength in driving out any ideological forces which
sought to compete with growing visions of abundance and happiness on
earth.16 Although liberal ideology and institutions nurtured the
commitment to material abundance and earthly happiness in America, they
neglected to instill an understanding of America\'s dependence on
natural resources. Foreign observers saw the dependence much more
clearly. For example, Tocqueville noted that: The physical causes,
independent of the laws, which contribute to promote general prosperity,
are more numerous in America than they have been in any other country in
the world, at any other period of history. In the United States not only
is legislation democratic, but Nature herself favors the cause of the
people.17 However, John Stuart Mill contended that despite such
conditions un- limited growth was impossible because the resources of
nature were not infinite. Mill considered nature\'s physical limits a
blessing and looked forward to a \"stationary state\" in which
population and capital would be balanced. He said such a state would
still man\'s productive passions and allow him to cultivate social and
moral endowments.l8 Nineteenth-century German biologist Ernest Haeckel
coined the term \"ecology\" in his effort to point out man\'s dependence
on his physical environment. Every system, he argued, reflects three
qualities-interde- pendence, complexity, and limitation.l9 But
ecological lessons ran contrary to the liberal belief that nature could
and must be conquered to serve man\'s purposes. And repeated warnings in
this century that man could exceed the carrying capacity of the
environment if he did not limit population or industrial processes have
gone largely unheeded.20

Of late, the warnings have intensified, notably in the reports of the
Club of Rome. In 1972 a sophisticated computer model developed by the
Club projected that unless population or industrialization is curtailed
drastically, worldwide collapse of the ecosphere will occur within 100
years.21 In 1974 an updated study responded to many of the criticisms
leveled at the 1972 report but came to only slightly more optimistic
conclusions: **survival is possible, but only if man diverts from the
path of \"undifferentiated growth\" to \"organic growth**.\" That is,
growth compatible with the requirements and limits of physical nature:
For the first time in man\'s life on earth, he is being asked to refrain
from doing what he can do; he is being asked to restrain his eco- nomic
and technical advancement, or at least to direct it differently from
before; he is being asked by all the future generations of the earth to
share his good fortune with the unfortunate-not in a spirit of charity,
but in a spirit of survival.22

Ironically, those who now foresee and advocate authoritarianism as the
only workable response to ecological problems anticipate the demise of
the liberal experiment in much the same way Socrates anticipated the
demise of democracy in Book vIII of the Republic. Socrates argued that
democracy inevitably leads to tyranny because of the refusal of the many
to accept proper limits. The absence of limits leads to chaos, which in
turn gives way to tyranny because any order is better than no order. The
democratic man, unable to distinguish right from wrong, proper from
improper, eventually accepts tyranny in preference to the chaos which
makes life unlivable. Hardin, Heilbroner, and Ophuls suggest that modern
man is, or soon will be, in a similar situation with respect to the
ecological crisis. Despite the hopes of \"technological optimists\" the
carrying capacity of the earth is bound to be exceeded unless rigid
limits are imposed. Faced with chaos and extinction, modern man will
find authoritarianism the only alternative.

Hardin contends that coercion is the only remedy. As a safeguard against
arbitrary coerion, he prescribes \"mutual coercion mutually agreed upon
by the majority of the people affected.\" 45 Presumably, majority rule
will reduce the possibility of arbitrariness since it will merely coerce
the minority to behave in ways that will not destroy the commons.

http://www.underminingdemocracy.org/overview/)

When asked not long ago about the effectiveness of the European Union's
posture toward an increasingly assertive and illiberal Russia, former
Czech president and communist-era dissident Vaclav Havel argued that the
European democracies had lost their voice and needed to take a firmer,
more open stand against abuses by their large and strategically
important neighbor to the east.\* He warned that today's Russia is
advancing a new form of authoritarianism, with methods of control that
are significantly more sophisticated than the classic totalitarian
techniques of the Soviet Union. Finally, the former Czech leader
lamented that as democratic states increasingly gave primacy to economic
ties in their relations with Russia, the promotion of human rights was
being shunted to the margins. The Kremlin was intensifying its
repression of the political opposition, independent journalists, and
civil society organizations, but **the response from established
democracies had softened to the point of inaudibility**. Havel was
referring only to Russia, but he could just as easily have been speaking
of China, another authoritarian country whose high rates of economic
growth and rapid integration into the global trading system have had the
effect of pushing the issues of democratic governance and human rights
to a back burner. China, like Russia, has modernized and adapted its
authoritarianism, forging a system that combines impressive economic
development with an equally impressive apparatus of political control.
As in Russia, political dissidents and human rights defenders in China
continue to challenge the regime. Chinese activists recently published
"Charter 08," a human rights and democracy manifesto that draws its
inspiration from Charter 77, the Czechoslovak human rights movement of
which Havel himself was a founder. But while Europe's anticommunist
dissidents were the focus and beneficiaries of a worldwide protest
movement, the Chinese intellectuals who endorsed Charter 08 labor in
virtual anonymity. Few in the United States and Europe are familiar with
the name of Liu Xiaobo, a respected literary figure and leader of
Charter 08, who has been imprisoned by the Chinese authorities since
December 8, 2008, for his advocacy of democracy and the rule of law in
China. Havel too spent years in jail during the Soviet period for
questioning the communist authorities' monopoly on power and their
denial of basic human and democratic rights. But the world paid
attention to his plight; even government leaders raised his case in
meetings with communist officials. In China, Liu remains in detention
and effectively incommunicado, and democratic leaders rarely speak out
publicly on his behalf. Today's advocates for freedom may be receiving
less attention, and less assistance, from their natural allies in the
democratic world because the systems that persecute them are poorly
understood in comparison with the communist regimes and military juntas
of the Cold War era. As a result, policymakers do not appear to
appreciate the dangers these 21stcentury authoritarian models pose to
democracy and rule of law around the world. It is within this context of
shifting and often confused perceptions of threats and priorities that
Freedom House, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Asia
undertook an examination of five pivotal states---Russia, China, Iran,
Venezuela, and Pakistan---to advance our common understanding of the
strategies and methods these regimes are employing, both within and
beyond their borders, to impede human rights and democratic development.
The countries assessed in Undermining Democracy were selected because of
their fundamental geopolitical importance. They are integrated into
larger economic, political, and security networks and exert a powerful
influence on international policy at the regional and global levels.
However, they are also geographically, economically, ideologically, and
politically diverse. Iran, a unique authoritarian polity ruled by Shiite
Muslim clerics, looms over the Middle East. The governing cliques in
Russia cloak their kleptocracy in a contradictory blend of Soviet
nostalgia and right-wing nationalism. Venezuela is ruled by a novel type
of Latin American caudillo who holds up Fidel Castro as his mentor.
China sets the standard for authoritarian capitalism, with rapid
economic growth sustaining a single-party political system. Pakistan, a
South Asian linchpin, is faltering under the legacy of military rule and
an extremist insurgency. Three of these countries---Iran, Russia, and
Venezuela---are heavily dependent on oil and gas exports, and exhibit
all of the peculiar distortions of so-called petrostates. The present
analysis comes at a time of global "**political recession**." According
to recent findings from Freedom in the World, Freedom House's annual
survey, political rights and civil liberties have suffered a net global
decline for three successive years, the first such deterioration since
the survey's inception in 1972. Freedom House's global analysis of media
independence, Freedom of the Press, has shown a more prolonged,
multiyear decline. While the consolidated authoritarian systems of
China, Russia, and Iran are rated Not Free in Freedom in the World, and
the rapidly evolving, semi-authoritarian states of Pakistan and
Venezuela are currently rated Partly Free, all five have played an
important role in contributing to the global setbacks for democracy.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China, Iran, Russia and Venezuela form a clique
of authoritarian states that use their wealth and influence to undermine
global democracy and rule of law, a study by U.S.-funded agencies said
on Thursday. The report, released on the 20th anniversary of China\'s
suppression of the Tiananmen democracy movement, says these states\'
challenge to Western democratic institutions represents a far \"murkier
picture\" than the Cold War because they are integrated into the global
economy and world bodies. \"Policymakers do not appear to appreciate the
dangers these 21st century authoritarian models pose to democracy and
rule of law around the world,\" said the study by Freedom House, Radio
Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Radio Free Asia, all prominent U.S.
democracy-promotion bodies. \"Just as they rule without law within their
borders, authoritarian regimes are **eroding the international rules and
standards built up by the democratic world over the past several
decades, threatening to export the instability and abuses that their
systems engender**,\" it said. The study said manufacturing and trading
power China and petro-states Iran, Russia and Venezuela shared strong
similarities despite their distinct political systems and backgrounds.
Authoritarian capitalist China and Russia have built systems that twin
\"impressive economic development with an equally impressive apparatus
of political control,\" it said. CURBS ON OPPOSITION, MEDIA Shiite
Muslim clergy-ruled Iran and Venezuela, run by \"a novel type of Latin
American\" strongman, held managed elections amid curbs on the
opposition and on media, it said. Ruling powers in the four states
buttressed their control with tight restrictions on the Internet and
media, promotion of nationalist versions of history in school textbooks
and use of state wealth to serve their own interests, said the report.
Internationally, **China has built a strong following in Africa and
Latin America with generous no-strings-attached aid packages. Russia,
Iran and Venezuela have used oil wealth to support regional client**s,
said the report. \"At the regional and international level, these
authoritarian regimes are undercutting or crippling the
democracy-promotion and human rights efforts of rules-based
organizations,\" it said. Targets included the United Nations, the
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the
Organisation of American States (OAS), added the report. The report also
included Pakistan because of its struggling democracy, history of
military rule and growing extremist insurgency.

[Advocates for the poor worry that putting too much responsibility in
the hands of profit-motivated companies could endanger the vulnerable
people the programs are intended to help.]{.underline} Federal rules
require state employees to make final decisions for some entitlement
programs, but letting a private contractor make the initial eligibility
cut could have a profound effect on welfare outcomes, they say.
Supporters of privatization argue that antiquated state eligibility
systems no longer are cost-effective, and say improvements best can be
accomplished by a high-tech, profit-motivated contractor with incentives
to operate efficiently. Texas policy-makers say their plan not only will
save taxpayer dollars but modernize the social services eligibility
process, allowing people to apply for support over the Internet, by fax,
through call centers and at self-serve kiosks. Currently social services
applicants must travel to their local social service offices during
business hours and wait in line to talk to a caseworker. Daniels, who
left his post as Bush's top budget advisor to run for governor in 2003,
grabbed headlines this year when he privatized an Indiana toll road,
granting a 75-year lease to a foreign consortium for \$3.8 billion. Most
agree that the state welfare eligibility process -- with long lines,
limited office hours and error rates in the 25 percent rage \-- needs
improvement. But advocates for the poor argue that the problems result
from underfunding and understaffing, not lack of expertise. "[The only
people with experience in the complex and sensitive work of determining
welfare eligibility are state workers.]{.underline} Why would you hire a
high-tech company to do that?" asks Stacey Dean of the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities, an advocacy group for the poor. [Other
privatization critics argue that transferring public services to private
companies has been plagued by quality-of-service problems for the last
two decades. The concept makes sense and state policy-makers always are
eager to save money, but in practice, privatization has failed more than
it has succeeded, says Mildred Warner, a privatization expert at Cornell
University.]{.underline} In an analysis of privatization of state and
local services over the last 20 years, [Warner concluded that the
majority of projects failed because of deteriorating quality of service.
And in more than half the cases, the projects did not save taxpayer
dollars, she said.]{.underline}

I fully accept, however, that solidarity is desirable for and conducive
to the stability of the welfare state, although I will not venture an
opinion as to whether it is necessary. I also realize that questions of
stability and legitimacy have a lot to do with each other (stability may
for instance depend upon the state\'s beingperceived as legitimate) but
I still insist that the two questions should be kept distinct
analytically. Needless to say, in an all-things-considered judgment, the
question of what makes the welfare state function (a question of which
stability is a part) will have to be addressed but that is not what I do
here. Besides, it is hardly a question best dealt with by philosophers.
I will concentrate on the normative question of legitimacy2. One thing
to note here is that for solidarity to do anything at all for the
legitimacy of a certain state arrangement it has to be solidarity on a
state wide level. \"Those very sentiments of loyalty and solidarity\"
mentioned above are sentiments for all people within the same state.
When the existence of, or the likelihood of, such sentiments is made a
component of legitimation, a picture is called to mind of a consensus
oriented society with a substantially moral common good that commands
everyone\'s allegiance. The unreality of this picture aside,
**integrating such sentiments in the legitimation of the welfare state
is to make the strength of the justice claims of the less fortunate
dependent upon the moral motivation of the more fortunate. I do not
accept that. Legitimation requires moral argument, not loose predictions
about what people may or may not be morally motivated**

## Privatization Raises Death Rate {#privatization-raises-death-rate .Tags}

**BBC News, 09** (1/15/09,
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7828901.stm)

[The researchers examined death rates among men of working age in the
post-communist countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
between 1989 and 2002. They concluded that as many as one million
working-age men died due to the economic shock of mass privatisation
policies. Following the break up of the old Soviet regime in the early
1990s at least a quarter of large state-owned enterprises were
transferred to the private sector in just two years. This programme of
mass privatisation was associated with a 12.8% increase in deaths. The
latest analysis links this surge in deaths to a 56% increase in
unemployment over the same period. However, it found some countries with
good social support networks withstood the turmoil better than others.
Where 45% or more of the population were members of at least one social
organisation, such as a church group or labour union, mass privatisation
did not increase mortality. But Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania
and Estonia were worst affected, with a tripling of unemployment and a
42% increase in male death rates between 1991 and 1994.]{.underline}

Privatization advocates like to stress the appeal of \"individual
choice\" and \"personal control,\" while assuming in their forecasts
that everyone\'s accounts will match the overall performance of the
stock market. But studies by Yale economist Robert J. Shiller and others
have demonstrated that individual investors are far more likely to do
worse than the market generally, even excluding the cost of commissions
and administrative expenses. Indeed, research by Princeton University
economist Burton Malkiel found that even professional money managers
over time significantly underperformed indexes of the entire market.
Moreover, a number of surveys show that most people lack the knowledge
to make even basic decisions about investing. For example, a Securities
and Exchange Commission report synthesizing surveys of investors found
that only 14 percent knew the difference between a growth stock and an
income stock, and just 38 percent understood that when interest rates
rise, bond prices go down. Almost half of all investors believed
incorrectly that diversification guarantees that their portfolio won\'t
suffer if the market drops and 40 percent thought that a mutual fund\'s
operating costs have no impact on the returns they receive. While
predictions vary significantly about how investment markets will perform
in the decades ahead, it\'s safe to say that any growth in individual
accounts under privatization will be significantly lower than what the
overall markets achieve.

[Privatization is the shifting of activities or functions from the
governmental sector to the private sector through vouchers, contracts or
joint ventures.]{.underline} Before we begin that shift, we should ask
whether the activity is uniquely governmental; whether privatization
would improve the economy and efficiency of the activity and whether
there is some reason to transfer a revenue stream from public to private
hands. According to the Urban Institute, [there is no evidence that
private service delivery is more effective than public service
delivery.]{.underline} The effectiveness of any service delivery depends
on the same key factors that the Committee on Government Reform and
Oversight have always considered: authority, accountability, and
clarity. The General Accounting Office found that [privatization in the
social service arena may be difficult to achieve because of a lack of
qualified bidders. In addition to possible contractor inexperience,
there may also be a problem with governmental inexperience in developing
contract specifications, reviewing contractor bids, negotiating bond and
performance issues and monitoring overall outcomes.]{.underline} Mr.
Chairman, I hope that we consider those findings today and determine if
those problems still exist.

groups and resources committed to the issue, a committed leadership, and
a predisposed target audience]{.underline}. When all these conditions
are present, [law can]{.underline}, but not necessarily [will, make a

propitious circumstances]{.underline} . . . [the contributions of legal
maneuvers to catalyzing defiant collective action will be partial,
conditional, and volatile over time]{.underline}." 82 [McCann's analysis
suggests that demos prudential dissents are neither necessary nor

**no judicial help is needed**.]{.underline} Th[ey are also not
sufficient because without a preexisting movement and the other
factors]{.underline} McCann identifies, [such dissents will accomplish
nothing]{.underline}. Indeed, Guinier provides two examples of
successful mobilization without demosprudential dissents. She describes
an extremely well-organized and successful movement to restore voting
rights to ex-felons in Rhode Island.83 She postulates that, "\[a\]
dissent from the Supreme Court could help in such an effort,"84 but
activists in Rhode Island did not need it. Similarly, she tells the
story of how social movements in Missouri defeated an attempt to enact a
very strict voter identification bill,85 also without the help of
demosprudential opinions.

Unpacked, the Constrained Court view maintains that [courts will
generally not be effective producers of significant social reform for
three reasons: the limited nature of constitutional rights, the lack of
judicial independence, and the judiciary's inability to develop
appropriate policies and its lack of powers of
implementation]{.underline}.

Whittington in 7 \<Keith E. (William Nelson Cromwell Professor of
Politics, Princeton University), *Political foundations of judicial
supremacy: the presidency, the supreme court, and constitutional
leadership in U.S. history*, 2007\>

There are a number of justifications for judicial supremacy, and these
justifications tend to overlap with the more political justifications
for judicial review. For some, [judicial supremacy is essential to
preserving the rule of law and preventing constitutional
anarchy]{.underline}. Thinking particularly of the competing
constitutional assertions of the state governments, this was Daniel
Webster's concern when he asked his congressional colleagues,
["\[C\]ould anything be more preposterous than to make a government for
the whole Union, and yet leave its powers subject, not to one
interpretation, but to thirteen, or twenty-four, interpretations?
Instead of one tribunal, established by and responsible to all, with
power to decide for all, shall constitutional questions be left to four
and twenty popular bodies, each at liberty to decide for itself, and
none bound to respect the decisions of others?" He doubted whether the
government would be capable "of long existing" under such
circumstances.]{.underline} For others, the value of judicial supremacy
is not in its capacity to provide authoritative legal settlements, but
in its capacity to provide substantively desirable legal settlements,
but in its capacity to provide substantively desirable legal outcomes.
The judiciary alone serves as a "forum of principle" within the American
constitutional system, capable of focusing on "questions of justice"
free from the din of "the battleground of power politics." For still
others[, judicial supremacy is regarded as "a permanent and
indispensable feature of our constitutional system" because the Court
alone functions as a countermajoritarian institutions securing the
liberties of individuals and political minorities]{.underline}.
Unfettered by political interests or popular prejudices, [the judiciary
can penetrate to the true meaning of the Constitution and the subtle
requirements of its principled commitments. Some questions---question of
justice and rights---are too important to be left in the hands of
legislative majorities or "the people themselves." Judicial supremacy
insures that they are not]{.underline}.

Political Science, Professor of Law, Fellow in the Center for Empirical

Precedent on the U.S. Supreme Court*, 2006\>

As a result of the norm of *stare decisis*, [the Court can incur
legitimacy costs by negatively interpreting a vital insititionalized
precedent. If instead of following a highly institutionalized, bedrock
precedent]{.underline} (i.e., a highly vital precedent) [the Court
chooses to treat the precedent in a negative manner, then the new policy
set by the Court may be perceived as being less legitimate]{.underline}.
In other words, just as there are greater legitimacy benefits to
following a particularly vital precedent, [there are potentially greater
legitimacy costs to overruling or otherwise undermining a precedent that
is highly vital]{.underline}. There will be less of a legitimacy cost,
on the other hand, when the Court negatively interprets a precedent that
is not particularly institutionalized or authoritative.

The vitality of a precedent, therefore, determines the extent to which
the justices bear a legitimacy cost when negatively interpreting the
precedent. [The more vital a precedent is, the greater the cost that
results from treating the precedent negatively.]{.underline} The
ideological distance between the justices and the precedent has no
effect on the costliness, in terms of legitimacy, resulting from
negative treatment. This argument can be represented as: legitimization
of new policy=-b~8~(V).

Still, knowing the nature of the political and judicial system of this
country, its inherent bias against the poor, against people of color,
against dissidents, we cannot become dependent on the courts, or on our
political leadership. Our culture\--the media, the educational
system\--tries to crowd out of our political consciousness everything
except who will be elected President and who will be on the Supreme
Court, as if these are the most important decisions we make. They are
not. They deflect us from the most important job citizens have, which is
to bring democracy alive by organizing, protesting, engaging in acts of
civil disobedience that shake up the system. That is why Cindy
Sheehan\'s dramatic stand in Crawford, Texas, leading to 1,600 anti-war
vigils around the country, involving 100,000 people, is more crucial to
the future of American democracy than the mock hearings on Justice
Roberts or the ones to come on Judge Alito.

19**93**. 271.

The decades of the 1960s and 1970s witnessed attempts to change much of
American society. Among these attempts was a movement to protect the
environment. Part of that movement, viewing courts as the crucial
institution capable of producing change, focused on litigation. Making
explicit analogies from the civil rights movement's use of the courts,
early environmental litigators explicitly aimed to contitutionalize a
right to a healthy environment. In later years, after a great deal of
congressional legislation, environmental litigator went to court aiming
to broadly interpret and strictly apply these legislative attempts to
protect the environment. In this overview, I argue that while the
attempt to constitutionalize a right to a healthy environment could not
overcome the constraints of the judicial system, once the other branches
acted, litigation was able to contribute to environmental protection
when one of the four conditions were present[.]{.underline} That is,
when other actors added incentives or costs, courts were effective.
Similarly, when market forces supported court decisions, litigation
helped. Finally, litigation made a difference when those officials
necessary for implementation were willing to act and use courts as
cover.

Instead, public school authorities may not use race as a criterion for
assigning students to schools, especially if they intend to produce
separate schools for white and black children.

Questions immediately arise as to what the Supreme Court meant. Does the

Does the ruling apply to public accommodations, swimming pools, and
movie theaters, or just to schools? What about singles ads in newspapers
and separate high school proms?

Immediately after a law-reform ruling like Brown, public authorities
will confront a host of questions like those just listed. And because
the new ruling appears to go against the grain, authorities, even those
with good will, likely will conclude that the Supreme Court could not
have meant that.

Affirmative action dies in multi-racial U.S. August 7, 2009

<http://www.ajc.com/opinion/affirmative-action-dies-in-111147.html>

So, why now? More often than not, it is the American left that gets lost
in absurd fantasies about race in this country. They pretend there has
been no progress in recent decades, even when they see the rise of a
black middle class and witness the election of a mixed-race president
and the likely confirmation of a Hispanic woman to the Supreme Court.
But today, it is the right wing and its supporters on the high court who
are making stuff up. They pretend that the nation is already so
transformed that a colorblind America is a reality and that affirmative
action is superfluous, so much so that white employees in a city fire
department --- an arena long dominated by Irish- and Italian-Americans
--- need help from the Supreme Court to get a promotion.

Rosenberg goes beyond the assertion that litigation strategies rarely if
ever produce significant change. He argues, correctly\" at they are
often counterproductive, for they can distort perceptions about where
resources are needed (pp. 339-42). The particular case of abortion,
Rosenberg notes that \"**reliance on the Court seriously weakened the
political efficacy of pro-choice forces. After the 1973 decisions, many
pro-choice: activists simply assumed they had won and stopped if
pro-choice activity. \...The political organization and momentum that
had changed laws nationwide dissipate in celebration of the Court
victory**\" (p. 339). The result, of course, was that pro-choice forces
abandoned the political arena to pro-life forces \--and then professed
surprise when prolife forces won important electoral victories. The
current broad public support for at least some abortion rights has
arisen largely because of the more recent decision of pro-choice forces
to return to the grass roots \--the place, Rosenberg tells us, where
real social changes take place (p. 341).

Courts Bring About Social Change? By Gerald N. Rosenberg. California Law
Review, LN

Rosenberg convincingly shows that courts cannot do it alone. Congress,
the White House, the states, and interest groups also play a pivotal
role. State efforts to legalize abortion before Roe, congressional and
administrative efforts to eliminate dual school systems, and the civil
rights and women\'s movements highlight a remarkable inventory of
non-judicial influences identified by Rosenberg. The Hollow Hope also
does an extraordinary job of demonstrating that numerous landmark
Supreme Court opinions were little known and even less discussed at the
time of decision. In fact, Rosenberg\'s evidence of the paramount role
played by nonjudicial forces is one of the strongest to date.

The Hollow Hope then offers abundant support for a more modest, more
accurate, and equally important thesis: the Supreme Court works within
and hence both influences and is influenced by a larger culture of
political and social interests. While severe problems in analysis still
remain, this rearticulation accomplishes Rosenberg\'s principal
objective of sobering those who endorse an active judicial role.

<http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&risb=21_T7110308857&format=GNBFI&sort=RELEVANCE&startDocNo=1&resultsUrlKey=29_T7110308860&cisb=22_T7110308859&treeMax=true&treeWidth=0&csi=7350&docNo=1>

One way to understand this mechanism is by means of a device that
narrative theorist Jean Stefancic and I have called the \"empathic
fallacy.\"
[n34](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n34)
A counterpart of the \"pathetic fallacy,\" familiar from literary
theory, the empathic fallacy is the mistaken belief that one can change
another\'s beliefs and attitudes through words alone. In literature, the
pathetic fallacy holds that nature is like us with moods, feelings, and
intentions that we can read and understand. The poet, seeing rain,
writes \"The world weeps with me.\"
[^[n35]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n35)

The empathic fallacy, which we coin, holds that narratives are of
relatively slight use in dispelling pre-existing ones. A reader
confronted with a new narrative\--a black heroine, for example, when she
has come to believe that blacks are lascivious and lazy, the opposite of
heroic\--will disbelieve it, or else pronounce the present case an
exception. We are, in a sense, our stock of narratives.
[^[n36]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n36)
These long held narratives form the basis against which we judge and
interpret new ones, such as ones about intelligent African Americans;
brave, resourceful women; energetic, hardworking undocumented aliens; or
loving parents who are gay or lesbian. Unless the new  \[\*152\] 
narrative is unusually clever, calculated to resonate with another that
we already hold, we tend to reject it as outrageous, extreme, or wrong.
[^[n37]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n37)

Supreme Court opinions are, of course, narratives\--stories\--and thus
subject to both mechanisms. Over the course of history, a few Supreme
Court opinions have contained such memorable language (\"Poor Joshua,\"
[^[n38]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n38)
\"There is no caste here\"
[^[n39]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n39))
that they have moved significant numbers of readers and hastened reform.
Rosenberg correctly notes their rarity, although he would be wrong if he
maintains that the number is zero.

CONCLUSION

Rosenberg\'s new edition, then, soberly reminds reformers not to place
undue reliance on courts and litigation. If dispossessed groups wish to
combat unfair practices and laws, the legal profession may offer them
symbolic victories, but little more. To secure real gains, they will
need to explore other avenues, including storytelling and literature,
electoral politics, and the oldest remedy of all\--self-help and
resistance to illegitimate authority.

Introduction: In the past decade, many American citizens have joined a
choir of voices lamenting the demise of public life in the United
Spates. The common chorus goes like this: Americans have forgotten how
to be citizens in a democracy and architects of public life. Our
democratic imagination is blunt, and public life in the United States is
dying a slow death. Civic -- engagement, the hallmark of American
democracy, is in rapid decline. According to the Committee for the Study
of the American Electorate, less than 50% of eligible voters
participated in the 1996 election and since the 1960s, voter
participation has declined by more than 2.5%. Close to 80% of the
population ignores local elections. The percentage of Americans who
regularly attend public, school or political meetings is at all-time
lows, and we seem willing to trust our government only in times of
extreme threat to the republic. The general consensus seems to be
there\'s not too much to be done about these problems of public apathy.
A 1995 New York Times ICBS News poll revealed that 59% of the people
polled could not point to one elected official they admired, and 79%
believed the government is \"run by a few big interests looking out for
themselves\" (Boyte, \"The Work of Citizenship\" 4). Increasingly,
Americans see local and federal government as entities that are separate
from their own interests and needs. We have lost a sense of Abraham
Lincoln\'s vision at the fields of Gettysburg when he declared \"that
this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom\--and that
government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not
perish from the earth.\"

Civil disobedience might appear to be a narrow exception to the rule
that law generally shapes behavior.
[n14](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n14)
But the civil disobedient breaks the  \[\*149\]  law openly,
nonviolently, and prepared to suffer the consequences.
[^[n15]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n15)
Although one could think of it as illustrating law\'s inefficacy, civil
disobedience occurs rarely enough that it does not shake our faith in
the system. And because the violator is prepared to accept punishment,
it is scarcely a frontal challenge to that system as a whole.

The same is true for cases in which a minority group believes the law is
both unjust and unlikely to change anytime soon. Then the group may seek
actively to frustrate enforcement. Anti-snitching campaigns in the black
community or efforts by Latino organizations to provide sanctuary or
supplies to undocumented immigrants crossing the desert on foot are
recent examples.
[n16](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n16)
But even here, the law exhibits a kind of efficacy\--the group seeking
to nullify it has to go through great efforts and incur considerable
risk to do so.Everyday experience with cases like these, then, conveys
the impression that law \"really works.\" How could Rosenberg seemingly
maintain the opposite?

Ultimately, Kapczynski wants to achieve even more. She seeks to theorize
how legal concepts mediate the interpretative frames that
socio-political mobilizations, such as A2K, deploy to assert their
interests. Kapczynski\'s discussion of framing theory advances the
scholarly conversation about law and popular mobilizations in a crucial
way: it helps to bury \"zero-sum\" propositions about law\'s effects on
social movements.
[^[n2]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.435232.11573510634&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249676208615&returnToKey=20_T7110505489&parent=docview#n2)
Those with a zero-sum view imagine law as a blunt instrument, either
breathing life into or taking it away from social movements. Other
scholars have offered a more satisfying account of law\'s impact on
social movements, one that emphasizes that even  \[\*282\]  failed
lawsuits can facilitate movements\' cultural and political agendas. But,
as I have previously argued, even these scholars sometimes duplicate the
zero-sum theorists\' tendency to ascribe far too much agency to the law,
[^[n3]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.435232.11573510634&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249676208615&returnToKey=20_T7110505489&parent=docview#n3)
a supposed \"master frame\" that animates activists\' each and every
move.

Kapczynski posits a more dynamic model of interaction between law and
social mobilizations. IP law and legal concepts are constitutive, but
not the center of the universe, in her analysis. She considers the
internal dynamics of the A2K mobilization on its own terms, and ascribes
tremendous agency to the activists, who manipulate law to great effect.
Kapczynski\'s \"gravitational pull\" thesis deftly illustrates her
conception of IP law as an important, but interactive and dialogic,
instrument of meaning. Frame theorists claim that collective actors use
frames for diagnosis, prognosis, and motivation. Legal concepts can be
deployed in a variety of ways within the framing process, Kapczynski
argues, occupying architectural, discursive, and strategic roles. A2K
activists have manipulated legal concepts to serve their interests, she
shows. But so, too, have corporate actors. In fact, some of the
article\'s most engaging passages explore not the A2K mobilization, but
how IP industries articulated and advanced their goal of expanding IP
protection in the marketplace of ideas.

Lastly, the federal courts, especially the U.S. Supreme Court, have
played important roles in national standard‑setting since 1954 when the
high Court struck down state laws permitting racial segregation in
public schools. n33 By relying on the Fourteenth Amendment to apply the
U.S. Bill of Rights to state and local action, the Court has virtually
transformed race relations as well as standards of practice in many
state and local government institutions, such as schools, libraries,
jails, prisons, and mental‑health facilities.

When Brown v. Board of Education came down, did Americans begin thinking
about and acting toward blacks differently? By and large they did not;
Rosenberg provides impressive evidence on this point.
[^[n17]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n17)

The movement‑centered approach urged here tends to interpret this latter
aspect of legal \"consciousness raising\" somewhat differently than many
characterizations by legal scholars. Judicial victories (or other legal
actions) do not \"reveal\" injustice to oppressed groups so much as
improve the chances that such injustices might be effectively challenged
by movement action in and out of the courts (McCann 1994). Moreover,
formal legal action alone rarely is likely to generate this
\"catalytic\" or \"triggering\" effect on movement constituents
(Rosenberg 1991). Only when concerted efforts are made by movement
leaders and organizations to publicize such evolving opportunities and
to use legal resources for movement‑building purposes is successful
organizing likely (McCann 1994). :1

## Courts mobilize social change -- wage discrimination rulings prove {#courts-mobilize-social-change-wage-discrimination-rulings-prove .Tags}

Howard **Gillman**, Law Professor, **1999** (THE SUPREME COURT IN
AMERICAN POLITICS, p. 72)

Perhaps the best documented responses to judicially created
opportunities and catalysts to action involve the mobilization of
political interest groups and social movements. Stuart Scheingold
demonstrated decades ago that Court actions could be resource in
mobilizing activity in a variety of ways, including activating and
organizing core constituent groups members as well as realigning support
from third parties. My own research on the politics of gender as pay
equity (or comparable worth) reform provided a detailed account of this
process. The very reform strategy its ::If was conceived by union and
civil rights lawyers responding to emerging Court ruling that
demonstration of race- or ,ex-based discriminatory impact could
establish a judiciable claim under the 1964 Civil Right Act. [Wage
discrimination]{.underline} claims were filed in federal courts during
the 1970s in an attempt primarily to develop new case law, but in many
lo(:al contexts such lawsuits also became key resources for organizing
women into unions or activating grassroots involvement among the already
organized. This activity increased dramatically in local and state
venues around the nation after the 1981 Court finding of sex-based [wage
discrimination]{.underline} against female prison guards in Co. of
Washington v. Gunther. In short, the movement [was conceived, born, and
developed as a formidable political force from opportunities and
resources created by federal court, and especially Supreme Court,
rulings]{.underline}. Parallel accounts have been provided for a variety
of both women\'s rights, animal rights, and the right of physically and
mentally disabled.

## Symbolic legal support to rights claims advance social movement {#symbolic-legal-support-to-rights-claims-advance-social-movement .Tags}

Michael **McCann**, professor of political science at the University of
Washington, Social Movements and America Political Institutions, ed.
Costain and McFarland, **1998**, p. 208

Finally, the symbolic normative power of rights claims themselves should
not be discounted. This point links Scheingold\'s (1974) \"myth of
rights\" and \"politics of rights\" analysis. Because citizens in our
society are responsive to (legally sensible) rights claims, defiant
groups often can mobilize legal norms, conventions, and demands to
compel concessions even in the absence of clear judicial (or other
official) support. This power of legal discourse has several related and
indistinguishable dimensions, including: abstract appeals to the moral
sensibilities of dominant groups; more concrete appeals to the interests
of dominant organizations in maintaining cooperative relations with
victimized groups, such as workers or consumers; and, perhaps, most
important, indirect appeals for moral censure from the general public
regarding the actions of specific powerful groups. The latter factor of
stigmatizing publicity distinguishes somewhat the potential impact of
legal action in high‑visibility social struggles from that in everyday
disputes. Formal legal actions by movements threaten to transform
disputes by mobilizing not just judges as third‑party intervenors but
also a variety of social advocacy groups, nonjudicial state officials,
and broader public sentiment or voting power through the catalytic
dynamic discussed in the last section. In other words, [litigation often
provides a powerful means for]{.underline}, in Schattschneider\'s (1960)
terms, \"expanding the scope of conflict\" in ways that enhance the
bargaining power of disadvantaged groups and raise the perceived risks
of hard line opposition from their foes.

## Even losses in the Courts lay the groundwork for political success {#even-losses-in-the-courts-lay-the-groundwork-for-political-success .Tags}

Richard **Gambitta**, Assistant Professor of Political Science at the
University in Texas at San Antonio, *Governing through Courts,*
19**81**, p. 276-77.

A court defeat or victory is a single episode in the litigation process,
quite as it is in the policy process. Concentration on the impact of
those episodes should not blind us to the functions performed by the
litigation itself. These latter need examination and explication as
well. Space limitations prevent a full discussion here, but a few items
may be listed, as an outgrowth of my research on Rodriguez, that may
provide a beginning. First, litigation provides access to influential
government arenas where those without political power in majoritarian
institutions can raise issues of concern, explain their contentions and
political grievances, and receive an attentive hearing on the merits of
their cause (Scheingold, 1974). Second, through the auspices of the
court, including the vehicles of discovery and subpoena, answers may be
secured to questions that might otherwise be ignored by bureaucrats,
elites, private persons, and corporations. Gochman secured answers to
extensive interrogatories detailing the extent of educational
disparities in Bexar County and in Texas. At that time, these vehicles
provided not only an expeditious and efficient method of securing that
information, but perhaps the only one as well. Third, litigation is a
means of publicizing an issue, of catching the attention, and perhaps
the sympathies, of various segments of the population. Periodically,
with increased frequency after the lower court victory, headlined or
featured articles would appear in newspapers and magazines reporting the
information that the litigants had acquired. For a five-year period, the
mag­nitude of the inequality resulting from the Texas school finance
policy appeared in the press. Fourth, the litigation process can
legitimize a political issue, regardless of the final judicial outcome.
The lower court victory in Rodriguez especially increased the legitimacy
of the Edgewood cause. And the five to four Supreme Court decision did
not return that cause to its original state. Fifth[,]{.underline}
litigation has the potential to mobilize and solidify political support
for an issue. It can do so for the defendant as well as the plaintiff,
but if one has little active support and few resources to begin with,
this function generally proves of positive worth. It did so in
Rodriguez. Most importantly, litigation, as mentioned earlier, often
contributes to the establishment of a legislative agenda. Significant
lawsuits can recast the nature of a debate, whether or not they are
ultimately victorious in court. In Rodriguez, earlier legislative
dialogue on reform focused on increased foundation support, not on
equalization. Subsequently, both topics were salient considerations. The
lower court decision has established school finance reform as a
legislative priority. Litigation can facilitate debates that otherwise
may not occur, thus setting in motion, at times, the process of policy
change, as it did in all three school finance cases. In a sense,
litigation can be viewed as a political campaign. The success of any
campaign needs to be measured not only by the vote registered in the
final election or court decision, but also by the impact that the
campaign has on current and future public policy. Like an independent
political campaign challenging the status quo, litigation that seeks
policy change often raises issues that incumbent legislators have
traditionally refused to address. Also, [it may distribute unfamiliar
information]{.underline} on the operations of a particular system,
publicize [certain abuses resulting from the implementation of ongoing
policies, and attempt to recast public and governmental debates, forcing
a legislative agenda that might lead to reform]{.underline}. Moreover, a
lower court victory, like an early primary victory, may change the
course of public policy and affairs even though that early win is never
repeated and is subseqently reversed.

If judicial rulings are relatively ineffective in changing social values
and practices in highly contested areas such as school desegregation,
abortion, environmentalism, and same-sex marriage, what accounts for
this failure?

I believe that the answer has to do with two related mechanisms. I call
the first the reconstructive paradox.
[^[n21]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n21)
This theory holds, essentially, that the greater a social evil\--say,
women\'s subordination or black slavery\--the more massive the social
effort required to eradicate it.
[^[n22]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n22)
Moreover, because the belief or practice is so deeply embedded, it is
invisible to many.
[^[n23]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n23)
Furthermore, the massive social effort necessary to alter a historical
social practice will inevitably collide with other social
values\--property rights, settled expectations, the southern way of
life, etc.\--that are widely held.
[^[n24]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.508483.7904757097&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249673190096&returnToKey=20_T7110310715&parent=docview#n24)
This effort will require shifts in spending and changes in the way we
relate to one another.

These efforts for social change, by contrast, will be out in the open,
where they will spark sharp resistance and the accusation that the

THE HOLLOW HOPE: CAN COURTS BRING ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGE? 91

As Rosenberg knows, the key precedential cases were brought to the Court
by interest groups or movements. According to Greenberg\'s account in
the JUDICIAL PROCESS AND SOCIAL CHANGE, for example, the LDF spon- sored
the litigation needed to achieve victory in Brown; it was the group\'s
persistence and not \"luck,\" that weakened \"the remaining legal
constraint.\" I think this is an important link, but one Rosenberg
largely overlooks.\
Another quibble I have is that some of his analyses are too casual.
Those on public opinion immediately come to mind. Because he does not
examine trends in survey data in a rigorous way, his observations tend
toward the pedestrian. Here is what he writes about public opinion on
abortion: \"there was clearly no rapid or large change in American\'s
support of abortion after the Court\'s decision\" (p.238). He may be
correct on an aggregate, first blush, level, but he misses an important
point brought to light in Franklin and Kosaki\'s (APSR, 1989: 751-777)
intriguing study: Roe did have the effect of polarizing the citizenry in
an unprecedented way

Since the pioneering work of Robert A. Dahl, [most]{.underline}
theorists have viewed the Court as one of many actors in the development
of national policies on a variety of issues. n3 The implication is that
the Justices are serious players in the game of societal transformation.
Some scholars, Alexander Bickel to the fore, have been more cautious,
suggesting a Court of limited ability to make changes. n4 Bruce
Ackerman, for example, has compared the Court to a group of brakemen
sitting in the last car of a train, able to make it stop but not to make
it go. n5 Yet in the popular image ‑‑ the one enshrined by the political
rhetoric of left \[\*1217\] and right alike ‑‑the Justices ride right up
in the engine and choose which track to take.

College of William and Mary) **1992**: Judicial Matters: The Hollow
Hope: Can Courts Bring About Social Change? California Law Review. Lexis

The Hollow Hope\'s assessment of abortion and women\'s rights, while
less detailed and less systematic, reaches similar conclusions. Indeed,
[Rosenberg]{.underline} uses identical metaphors, [speaking of the Court
as \"join\[ing\],\" \"not creat\[ing\],\" \"a current of social change
and a tide of history]{.underline}\" (p. 265). Moreover, like his
analysis of civil rights, Rosenberg sees courts as trying to play a
leadership role but failing: \"As with civil rights . . . [the Court is
far less responsible for the changes that occurred than most people
think]{.underline}\" (p. 201); \"[advocates of women\'s rights have
\'won\' quite a number of legal cases]{.underline}\" (p. 212), **[but
\"precedent-setting decisions in women\'s rights have produced little
because courts lack all the essential tools required of any institution
hoping to implement change]{.underline}**\" (p. 227).

[Roe v. Wade]{.underline}, rather than being characterized as a
watershed, [is seen as solidifying a \"widespread, vocal, and
effective\" pro-choice lobby]{.underline} (p. 184). That forty-six state
laws were invalidated under Roe is downplayed; highlighted, in its
stead, are statistics showing that the rate of legal abortions rose more
dramatically the two years before Roe (300%, from 193,500 in 1970 to
586,800 in 1972) than the two years after Roe  \[\*1035\]  (52%, from
586,800 in 1972 to 898,600 in 1974) (pp. 178-80).
[Rosenberg]{.underline} also [minimizes Roe\'s impact by arguing that
nonjudicial market mechanisms were critical in effectuating the
decision. Specifically, had Roe demanded that abortions be performed in
hospitals, the widespread refusal of hospitals to perform
abortions]{.underline} (only 17% of public and 23% of private hospitals
perform abortions) suggests that the case\'s impact would have been
negligible (pp. 189-201).

[Rosenberg\'s examination of \"women\'s rights\" is also critical of the
Court]{.underline}. Noting that [the gap between men\'s and women\'s
earnings has stayed constant since 1955, that litigation has not
affected the wage structure, that most employment is sex-segregated, and
that the ABA Committee on Judicial Selection typically gives better
ratings to men than women, Rosenberg deems court action in this area
inconsequential]{.underline} (pp. 207-12). [The crux of the problem,
instead, is a long list of social ills, including domestic violence,
disproportionate household work, inadequate child support, and biased
laws]{.underline} (pp. 212-26).

Social Change: A Reassessment of Rosenberg\'s The Hollow Hope: Can
Courts Bring About Social Change? Journal of Law and Policy. Lexis

Certain [deficiencies in Rosenberg\'s approach]{.underline} do [limit
the value of his conclusions about functionalism. Functionalism is a
theory about how]{.underline} law and its interpretation by [courts
influence society. Rosenberg is unable to address questions of influence
fully because he uses inappropriate methods and because he ignores the
most important aspect of judicial influence \-- the power of courts to
redefine structures and expectation]{.underline}s. Admittedly, whatever
their mode of influence, judges are not always able to effectuate their
goals. [Rosenberg]{.underline} claims that such failures illustrate the
ultimate impotence of the courts. Nonetheless, he [fails to explain how
he can conclude]{.underline}, at the same time, [that the legislature
and the executive are effective institutions even though these bodies
face implementation difficulties comparable to those which, for
Rosenberg, illustrate that courts are ineffective agents of
change]{.underline}. Finally, [Rosenberg fails to inquire whether
results would be different if courts did not seek to effect change.
Without answering this question, Rosenberg cannot compare the relative
effectiveness of various government branches or definitively conclude
that courts do not influence society.]{.underline}

Despite the deficiencies in [Rosenberg\'s analysis]{.underline}, his
work still [offers important contributions]{.underline} to the ongoing
discussion of functionalism. [We conclude that Rosenberg\'s analysis
actually demonstrates that the Court is, indeed, an effective
institution. When we realize that **the Court is but one branch of
government, which, like every other branch, must work with others to
effect its goals,** Rosenberg\'s claim that courts can effect change in
combination with others is in reality an important affirmation of
judicial efficacy and, ultimately, of the functional role of
law.]{.underline}

[Rosenberg\'s inquiry is flawed from the outset because he fundamentally
misperceives the nature of influence and which evidence properly
indicates its presence. Influence]{.underline} need not be manifested as
blatantly as Rosenberg suggests it must be, but it [may involve subtle
changes in assumptions and minor shifts among coalitions. Similarly,
Rosenberg\'s theory of causation fails to recognize that major changes
most often unfold over extended periods of time and that people may not
respond to a particular event immediately]{.underline}. If Rosenberg is
to provide sufficient support for his theory, he must expand his
inquiries far beyond their current limits and reestablish them upon a
different and improved foundation. [Rosenberg assumes that the influence
of any event may be adequately measured by noting direct responses to
it: actors may acknowledge its influence, or their reactions may betray
its direct effect on their decisions.]{.underline}

Yet it is also likely that they will attempt to mask this influence.
They may, for instance, wish to give the impression that they have been
right from the beginning]{.underline}. Politicians are not big on
footnotes.
^[n82](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.289762.53502169246&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249947444598&returnToKey=20_T7121307062&parent=docview#n82)^
Just as the origins of reform may be masked, so too [advances in reform
need not be indicated by wild swings in public opinion. **Politics is
often a game of inches**. The civil rights movement broke out in a
country where candidates were considered \"safe\" if they gained 55% of
the vote,]{.underline} and a large percentage of districts were not
safe.
[^[n83]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.289762.53502169246&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249947444598&returnToKey=20_T7121307062&parent=docview#n83)
[Even the expectation of small changes in public opinion could have a
significant impact on political actors]{.underline}. Often, [this
\"swing vote\" was held by blacks. Rosenberg]{.underline} thus [errs in
assuming that the Court could only influence policy by engendering
massive swings in public opinion; altering the views of only a few may
have an explosive impact in such an atmosphere.]{.underline}
[^[n84](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.289762.53502169246&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249947444598&returnToKey=20_T7121307062&parent=docview#n84)^
In this political environment, the mere fact that Brown altered the law
of the land could have had significant impact itself. It was not even
necessary that anyone be converted to the cause of
desegregation]{.underline}. Some of [those who disagreed with the Court
might have become convinced that the rule of law was more important than
continued support for segregation. Even]{.underline} such
[limited]{.underline} and tepid [support]{.underline} for Brown [could
have supplied the necessary margin of political victory to reformers in
certain districts]{.underline}.

## Social change doesn't need to be seen, court decisions simply need to challenge current assumptions to provide for change elsewhere {#social-change-doesnt-need-to-be-seen-court-decisions-simply-need-to-challenge-current-assumptions-to-provide-for-change-elsewhere .Tags}

[Even if Brown actually engendered opposition to segregation itself,
such opposition need not have been open and active]{.underline}.
Further, the decision need not even have gained a visible and prominent
place in public or elite discussion. Game theory teaches that merely
altering signals to indicate that additional choices are available may
suffice to induce significant change in a situation where players
previously doubted the availability of alternatives.
[^[n85]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.289762.53502169246&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249947444598&returnToKey=20_T7121307062&parent=docview#n85)
[Brown need only have challenged the assumption that there was no option
but loyalty to the segregationist status quo.]{.underline}
[^[n86]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.289762.53502169246&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249947444598&returnToKey=20_T7121307062&parent=docview#n86)
[Not only did Rosenberg entirely fail to address this possibility, but
his insistence upon a purely statistical approach disables him from
adequately analyzing this important possibility]{.underline}.
Manifestations of power and influence cannot be adequately investigated
with a purely quantifiable approach, as Dahl\'s attempt to do so
indicates.
[^[n87]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.289762.53502169246&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249947444598&returnToKey=20_T7121307062&parent=docview#n87)
This means that assessments of influence may require historical or other
indices of impact.

[Judicial decisions can change assumptions]{.underline} not only by
opening new options for opposition, but also [through their power to
grant legitimacy to certain claims and to redefine norms of
institutional action]{.underline}. Undoubtedly, [by changing the
constitutional rule, Brown opened new doors for resisting segregation
through actions at law]{.underline}. But it did more. [It invalidated
arguments in favor of segregation, both by excluding them from the
courtroom and by stigmatizing their use in public debate.]{.underline}
[[^n88^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.289762.53502169246&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249947444598&returnToKey=20_T7121307062&parent=docview#n88)
It also opened an avenue for changing the law elsewhere, as courts and
others applied the newly approved desegregationist argument in other
situations.]{.underline}

[Rosenberg]{.underline} also fundamentally [misunderstands the nature of
judicial policy making and policy making in general. His approach
evaluates judicial and legislative policy making under different
standards and]{.underline}, as a result, [unreasonably elevates
legislative and executive influence over that of courts. **When viewed
in light of the true nature of the policy making process, Rosenberg\'s
analysis actually demonstrates that the Court is an effective agent of
social change**]{.underline}.

[Rosenberg]{.underline} paints an unfairly impotent picture of the
Supreme Court, in part, because he [refuses to examine the work of lower
courts. The Supreme Court generally does not implement the rules it
develops, but relies upon lower courts to apply its rules in particular

closely were important Supreme Court decisions followed, and how often
were they relied upon? Were these decisions applied in new situations
and extended to other areas of the law? Were lower courts amenable to
claims under these rules, or did they consistently resist their
implementation? Who won and who lost, and how was this changed by
decisions of the Supreme Court? How did new found success or failure in
litigation affect policy in other arenas? [By refusing to pursue this
rich line of inquiry]{.underline} and preferring to reign his inquiry
within an arbitrary time period, [Rosenberg\'s analysis is severely
impoverished and his conclusions are brought into question.]{.underline}

While Rosenberg may have forsworn systematic analysis of the process
through which Court decisions are implemented, he did not forswear all
reference to the process. Rosenberg argues that biased judges and
obstructionist interest groups placed such monumental obstacles in the
path of judicial efficacy that the courts could not be labeled

Congress.

eager to ascribe change to forces other than the Court on the basis of
purely post hoc argument.

Perhaps, then, the cases that ought to be examined are the cases in the
late 1960s and early 1970s, and Rosenberg\'s ten year time frame should
be adjusted accordingly. As Nathan Hakman, one of our constitutional law
mentors, used to say, \"Courts first decide cases and not causes.\"
[Rosenberg has entirely missed this simple truth.]{.underline}

[Finally, Rosenberg\'s definition of what constitutes the \"significant
social reform\" that he seeks to examine is dangerously
imprecise]{.underline}.
[^[n121]{.underline}^](http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/frame.do?tokenKey=rsh-20.289762.53502169246&target=results_DocumentContent&reloadEntirePage=true&rand=1249947444598&returnToKey=20_T7121307062&parent=docview#n121)
How many people must be affected for reform to be significant? What
types of people? How much must change before reform has \"occurred\"?
All these questions are left open, and the indeterminacy of this phrase
undermines the force of Rosenberg\'s arguments throughout.

**Rosenberg's claims aren't warranted- groups he says lose hope are
activist lawyers**

Social Change"

Although he draws on many sources and quotes many of them at length,
Rosenberg is not at all systematic in his effort to locate those re-
formers and other observers whose hopes he finds hollow. Perhaps he
views it as unnecessary; after all, these views may be so commonly held
that it is impossible to locate a school of proponents. But to say that
he has not clearly identified this group does not mean that he has not
identified anyone. By my rough count, he mentions 42 advocates of the
\"dy- namic court\" whose hopes he concludes are hollow.\'0 (The
inclusion of several of these people might be challenged because he
mentions them only in passing or only briefly quotes from them.) Of this
list nearly half are activist lawyers and another quarter are judges and
law professors. The rest are a smattering of political scientists,
journalists, and others whose professions I cannot identify. But with
respect to the frequency of cita- tions and the length of quotes, the
focus is overwhelmingly on activist lawyers and judges. In essence, he
contrasts the wishes, desires, and hopes of these reformers with
subsequent social policy developments related to important Supreme Court
decisions. So far as I can tell**, this group of reformers is an ad hoc
collection of activists (and their friends) who exaggerate claims about
their own efficacy.** That there is a huge gap between their views and
subsequent policies is hardly surprising. Imagine such a study of sports
teams, contrasting coaches\' preseason rhetoric with the teams\'
performances during the sea- son (\"This team has a legitimate shot at
the championship; on a good day it can beat anyone\"-yet the team
finishes three games out of the cellar). Or imagine someone reporting
that there is a huge gap between candi- dates\' campaign pronouncements
and policies after election. Would any- one complain that the coaches
had hollow hopes or that the information about the candidates is
newsworthy? I suspect that no one other than a few sports writers, or
opposition candidates, would find it worthwhile to take such rhetoric
seriously. Certainly no one would take it as a disinter- ested diagnosis
of the strength of the team or the candidate. Yet this is more or less
what Rosenberg has done; he has taken the rhetoric of the intensely
partisan at face value and then shown that per- formance falls short of
rhetoric. What he does not do is offer any rea- son-convincing or
not-why observations of this group should be taken so seriously. I
emphasize this because his book is so relentless. Each case study
follows a similar format: each begins with a mobilization of quotes by
reformers which are then followed by a piling on of data to show that
they were wrong. But Rosenberg never pauses to ask what the views of
these reformers signify or why they are privileged voices to be taken so
seriously.

In each of these case studies-and others not mentioned here-Rosenberg
concludes that the Court was weak because the goals of the re- formers
were not met. But as I have tried to show, the Court never even
attempted to do what he observes it did not do. It is hard to know what
to make of such observations. At best it is myth debunking, although if
so, we need to know more about the myth than he tells us. He promises to
explicate this myth with his second provocative metaphor, \"flypaper.\"
But, as we shall see, he-does not keep the promise.

http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/lsociq17&type=Text&id=753

Who is attracted to the Court and why? A substantial number of people
attribute exaggerated powers to the courts. It would be interesting to
know who they are. Unfortunately Rosenberg does not explore this group
systematically. At the outset of each case study he marshals quotes from
a variety of sources revealing that a number of prominent people have
had great expectations from litigation. But he provides no sustained
discussion as to how he selected those to be quoted, or who they are-why
their views matter. One way to summarize his argument is as follows:
\"**A lot of people think the Court is really powerful, but my study
reveals that it isn\'t.\"** Even if he is correct, and I am impressed
with the data he has marshaled, his study is at most a successful effort
at debunking an ill-de- fined myth than it is in explaining the nature
of the Court\'s powers or the pervasiveness and significance of the
myth. A more sociological and theoretically informed study would have
used the myth-the \"hollow hope\"-as the beginning of inquiry rather
than the conclusion. It would have gone beyond myth debunking and asked,
Who holds this \"hollow hope\"? Why do they persist in holding a belief
that is so patently false? What functions does the myth serve? What is
the nature of the flypaper Court? What functions does it serve?
Throughout the book, Rosenberg raises such questions, but he never
addresses them. Indeed, his brief concluding chapter, \"The Fly Paper
Court,\" is a dis- appointment. The metaphor promises to explore the
seductions of the Court and those attracted to it. Yet it only
reiterates his point that those who place their faith in the Court as an
engine of social change are mis- guided. This, of course, is an
important point, but the question is, Why are so many people then
attracted to the Court? We know why flies are attracted to flypaper;
flypaper is aromatic and flies are dumb. But the peo- ple Rosenberg
identifies who are attracted to litigation are not so dumb; they are
prominent lawyers, journalists, and public officials. How can they be so
misguided? One can also ask, Is the metaphor apt? Certainly the metaphor
is powerful: The Court attracts would-be reformers only to entrap them
in a futile struggle. But flypaper is designed for this purpose. Is the
Court? Is the Court responsible for trapping would-be reformers? Or has
someone else fostered the myth? And is it in fact as dysfunctional as
Rosenberg argues? Whatever the case, the anomaly Rosenberg has
identified-the deep belief in a powerful Court coupled with a finding of
abject weakness- should have been a central problematic in the study. To
conclude that the Court is like flypaper that entangles would-be
reformers in a fruitless enterprise is to pose a problem, not conclude
the analysis. Thus the unasked and unanswered questions: Who fosters the
myth of the dynamic court? Who maintains it? What social functions does
it serve? Rosenberg\'s book would have been far more satisfying had he
pursed such questions.

Next, we can consider emulation. Civil rights activists' success in
using the courts led a range of other interests to adopt litigation
strategies, and indeed, even the organiza- tional structure of the NAACP
and its Legal Defense Fund. O'Connor, for example, describes pressure
from board members of the National Organization for Women (NOW) to
create a subsidiary directed to litigate on behalf of women's rights.39
Baker, Bowman, and Torrey report that the feminist movement's concern
with discrimination against women, and inequality between women and men,
led them to adopt the NAACP's approach as "the only obvious model . . .
. . following the NAACP's example, liberal feminists worked within the
system to achieve change by focusing on 'gaining equal opportunity for
women as individuals.' " 40 They report that NOW deliberately "cop- ied
the methods, structures, and funding techniques of the NAACP Legal
Defense Fund and concentrated, like that organization, on the courts as
an instrument of change through litigating cases raising constitutional
claims." 41 Costain notes that members of Congress made the con- nection
between women and blacks, and copied legisla- tive provisions for civil
rights as well.42 The successful example of litigation, and the simple
story about social change implicit in a judicial pronounce- ment,
encouraged the strategy, and groups sought to frame themselves as like
African Americans in some way, usually as a distinct group that suffers
discrimination. Activists organized to provide for equal protection
under the law, the same standard articulated in Brown, regardless of the
nature of their constituency.43 The model was most easily adopted by
other ethnic minorities and women, but it spread to consumers, disabled
people, anti-war activists, crusaders against poverty, and even animal
rights and envi- ronmental activists. Handler reports that the war on
poverty's legal services program, started in 1967, was explicitly
modeled on the NAACP and the Legal Defense Fund,44 as was the Envi-
ronmental Defense Fund, also founded in 1967.45 In these cases, as with
the NAACP, dedicated organizations raised money to hire lawyers to ﬁle
litigation to achieve their political goals, to win political
visibility, and to raise more money. The iconic status of the Brown
decision, in which the Supreme Court reversed a long-standing precedent
and articulated a clear vision of individual rights that man- dated,
although it did not effect immediate change in laws and policies,
provided an incredible temptation for envi- ronmental groups. If the
Court could ﬁnd a right for equal access to education, perhaps it could
also ﬁnd a Constitu- tional right to a clean environment.46

Second, some social movement organizations have extensive resources
invested in the pursuit of social change through litigation. Activists
are committed to social change, but they are also bound to support the
survival of their organizations, and to make best use of the tools and
expertise they have. Social movements comprise multi- organizational
ﬁelds, including groups that specialize in litigation. In order to
sustain the ﬂow of resources into these groups, they must maintain an
identity distinct from their allies, and continue to offer the promise
of victory.58 **Continued litigation ﬁlls a distinct organizational
niche within a social movement, and makes use of well-established
organizational expertise; even in the absence of social change, it is an
organizational survival strategy.** Third, like organizations,
individuals have investments in particular identities and tactics.
Lawyers committed to social change employ familiar tactics and make use
of the skills they have. The choice of the legal system as a venue for
political action reﬂects not only beliefs, but educa- tional and
professional investments that support those beliefs. It's easy to
imagine the cause lawyer doubting the effectiveness of shifting his or
her skills and efforts to an alternative political venue. Finally,
advocates of social change continue to litigate at least partly because
their opponents do. When an oppos- ing group seeks to pursue its
interests through the courts, it virtually forces its opponent to do the
same---or risk leaving a potentially important front in the political
battle undefended.59 Groups can try to respond to their oppo- nents by
bringing alternative cases to the legal system, ones with more favorable
facts or district judges; mini- mally, they can ﬁle amicus curiae briefs
in opposition to other advocates **As long as either side sees the
courts as a potentially relevant institution, numerous groups will
continue to channel their efforts there. Clearly, efforts to pursue
social change through the courts continue against long odds of
success.**

experimenting with new ones, learning innovative approaches, and
addressing societal problems. To appreciate this capacity, we must
attend to the conceptual lenses through which we examine Congress and
craft multiple theoretical perspectives that can aid us in looking
beyond momentary personalities and short-term stalemate to see
the]{.underline} [dynamic]{.underline}, historical [processes at
play]{.underline}. In doing so, [we must bring to Congress the
common-sense judgment we bring to daily life, taking care to focus on
the motives and strategic behavior of participants in the foreground, on
the shifting background contexts, and then ultimately on the critical
ways in which the ideas that participants hold about politics and
society shape their strategies and actions]{.underline}. As we do so,
crafting social choice theories to analyze the foreground, social
structure theories to interpret the background, and social learning
theories to comprehend the role of ideas, [we see an overall
pattern]{.underline} that no one of our theories could fully illuminate,
and [that helps us understand how Congress can constructively respond to
societal problems.]{.underline} Through these multiple lenses, we see
the contest for governing power that ensures partisans will highlight
societal problems as they challenge for control of Congress. We see the
dynamic societal changes that generate new citizen demands and policy
challenges. And we see the coming of a new generation of legislators,
social activists, and engaged citizens who push Congress to experiment
with fresh ideas, address the pressing policy challenges, and solve
societal problems.

[To enlarge the scale of such relationships to a giant mass is to effect
a near total transformation of reality]{.underline}. For example, the
workings of a modern mass political party, which may number millions,
becomes an entity where the morality factor has largely been
supplemented by that of power. [Whatever moral objectives an individual
may seek to pursue by joining a large mass organisation, his
relationship with it can only be a power relationship]{.underline}. This
is fundamental to his reasons for becoming a member at all; he is
seeking, after all, to change the way power in society is used, but his
individual power is emphatically unequal to that of the central
controlling mechanisms. [**It is in fact power he surrenders by the mere
fact of becoming a member. The same power cannot be in two places at the
same time, either a member has it**, as in his bowls club by the small
size of the club, where his membership is a significant factor in
controlling such power as it may deploy]{.underline}**, [or he
doesn\'t]{.underline}**, as in a mass political party where he is an
insignificant cog in a massive wheel controlled by others at the centre.
[The mere fact of enlarged size makes size itself an assault on the

Current thinking in any case takes no account of an essential
prerequisite for the successful working of any federation. [History is
eloquent that if the members of a federation are significantly unequal
in size and strength it will only be a matter of time before the bigger
members dominate it]{.underline}. This proved the case in \'Germany\',
which, after its formation by Bismark, soon became dominated by Prussia
and in the USSR, which was dominated by Russia. What ensues is not so
much a federation as an empire under the dominance of the most powerful
member. It is noticeable that in [the USA and in Switzerland, two of the
most successful federations in the record, no single member is strong
enough to dominate the rest]{.underline}. This does not of course
resolve the problem of the power drives of any federation when it gets
big enough to dominate other federations, as the USA does today. We can
anticipate the prospect of China, or India, achieving a degree of power
to rival that of the USA, especially when the power of the latter
inevitably declines. But this does not resolve the problem of war so
much as open up the prospect of even bigger global wars between rival
federations. Hence any projects for a world federation will need to
involve a massive scaling down of the big powers that now dominate world
affairs so that the members achieve some approximation of parity in
terms of size and strength. **[The same power cannot be in two places at
the same time; either people have power in their hands or they don\'t.
Either giant governments and corporations have it in their hands or they
haven\'t]{.underline}**. Nevertheless the dream of some such
international authority continues to shine like a beacon in the eyes of
many pacifists and peace lovers, as well as being vaguely acknowledged
as a good thing by a great many other people. **[The fact is that they
have no grasp at all of the power realities involved or that any such
body would be only too to likely make peace-lovers and their ideals its
first victims]{.underline}**. But then, an anxious enquiring voice will
be heard to venture, \'Won\'t largely self-governing local communities
or bioregional provinces sometimes want to make war on other
neighbouring communities?\'

We need to see that in any mass form of society (i.e., one in which
empowered local communities just do not exist), these powerful forces
have little difficulty in deploying their abundant resrouces so as to
secure an almost unlimited degree of acquiescence to their standards and
values of a vast mass of uncritical, and all too often uncaring,
individuals- who nevertheless have the power to vote. Ordinarily [nature
provides an abundance of leadership in every]{.underline} kind of
[community which will take the initiative in tackling its
problems]{.underline}; but [when communities as such cease to exist, as
**centralized forms of power come to exercise a dominance over the
affairs of the mass, such localized leadership loses the mainspring of
its capacity to act**;]{.underline} it no longer has a stage, one might
say, on which it can perform. [It is this factor of negated or
subjugated leadership which gives added signifncance to the
proliferating number and variety of protest, reform or campaigning
groups which today are such a marked feature of public life. An
empowered community would not find itself faced with such groups for the
simple reason that the conduct of its affairs would reflect the wishes
of its members as a matter of course.]{.underline} [Its leaders, instead
of founding or joining some national movement, would be largely running
the local show]{.underline}; but since there is no local show to run, if
matters as coffee mornings, jumble sales, or discos to raise funds for
table tennis tables for teenagers are excluded, what role is there left
for it to play in matters which will help to determine its character,
its use of local resources or the general quality of life? [So that what
we are now observing is a form of government which, because of the
nature of the behind-the-scenes forms of power which sustain it and
because of the values these forces are concerned to promote, is
compelled to act in accordance with those values]{.underline} (which a
mass electorate has been manipulated into adopting as its own), [**is
creating a multitude of problems which the more public spirited elements
are being driven to seek either to reform, combat or negate**. So that
in a very real sense we are in the grip of a process of government of
the people and supposedly for the people which is **creating problems,
often of crisis proportions, which under a system of government by the
people would scarcely arise at all.**]{.underline}

[As part of the efforts to promote the participation of the people in

policy of devolution of power and authority to sub-national governments
(generally referred to as decentralization)]{.underline} [is
increasingly adopted and applied in many countries as one of the tenets
of "good governance".]{.underline} This is based on the premise that
decentralized [governance provides a structural arrangement and a level
playing field for stakeholders and players to promote]{.underline}
peace, [democracy,]{.underline} and development. [Many countries are
promoting decentralized governance as a measure for democratization,
people empowerment and poverty reduction]{.underline}. However, the
efforts in this regard are not moving at the same pace, with the same
political conviction, using equally competent capacities, and with the
same success. Some countries have gone beyond political hesitation and
put in place policies of decentralization but they lack the requisite
capacities for the implementation. Others are still politically
hesitant, not sure of the role of decentralized governance in
democratization, people empowerment, and poverty reduction.

the size of the states themselves; too big to be able to respond to the

course; in consequence our societies are in effect running amok in terms
of environmental destruction, social despoliation, the squandering of

[The civic engagement of ordinary citizens with voluntary associations,

feature of strong democracies]{.underline}. Further, [a fundamental
feature of democratic governmental structure is its relationship to
civil society, defined as \"voluntary social activity not compelled by
the state\"]{.underline} (Bahlmueller, 1997, p. 3). [Through voluntary
participation in civil society associations at the local and regional
level, citizens pursue activities that potentially serve the public
good. Through this rudimentary civic engagement, citizens learn the
attitudes, habits, skills, and knowledge foundational to the democratic
process]{.underline}-(Patrick, 1998). Unfortunately, in 1998 the
National Commission on Civic Renewal (NCCR) highlighted the declining
quantity and quality of civic engagement at all levels of American life.
A number of other studies concur on the decline of involvement in civic
activities (Bahlmueller, 1997; McGrath, 2001; Putnam, 1995). [This
concern about the nature and extent of civic engagement in the United
States has impacted the debate on the proper role of higher education in

the higher education response to this perceived need for revitalizing

increasing citizen participation in government at all levels. [Colleges

empirical studies of political engagement, community-based

[In general, decentralized government can be a very important element in
the facilitation of an active and lively civil society. The more
decentralized government is, and the stronger local governance capacity
is, the more opportunities - in essence, the more arenas - are provided
for the emergence of civil society institutions. In fact, very often it
is the existence of local governance, combined with the emergence of
local civil society institutions, that truly creates the pluralism that
is so central to democratic institutional development. In that regard,
local governments can and have played crucial facilitating roles in the
development of vibrant civil societies. Local government policy and
administrative practice can profoundly impact upon the capacity for
civil society to emerge and play a role in governance. Likewise, the
actions of local political leaders can either be supportive of or create
major impediments to civil society development.]{.underline}

Our prospects of countering the evil forces promoting the global crisis
and of making any significant progress are bleak indeed if we do not
grasp that if people have no real power to enable their moral judgements
to be reflected in the general life processes of their own communities,
if they do not themselves control their social structures, their
schools, post office, bank, police, hospital, transport and their
welfare services; if they have no local power to determine these
matters, if they do not have their own locally elected representatives
to sit, with others similarly elected, on boards which govern matters of
wider import, including public utilities such as water, gas, electricity
and not least, governing the content of radio and television, they have
no effective power at all. The very structures disempower them and it is
a mere abuse of language to describe any such process as democratic.
Democracy, we should never cease to hold, does not mean government of
the people, nor government for the people, both are essentially
totalitarian concepts, it means government by the people. All else is

To talk of the need for a new party is the old fashioned giantist
approach; what we need is thousands of new locally-based independent
political parties up and down the country! And in the world at large
millions of them. The pressing need of the moment is for a political and
economic programme they could adopt which affirms at every level the
imperative need for the human scale as a prerequisite for the effective
working of democracy. And the programmes? Each local neighbourhood party
will decide its own as a matter of course, which does not mean they
would not promote a common series of principles which serve their common
interests. Such principles would relate at the national level to
fundamental provisions for liberty, freedom and independence, involving
of course a complete rejection of any association with the European
Community. But cut the cackle all along the line; currently discussion
is non-stop about what government policy should be on a host of matters
which have been removed from local control. Our millions of new parties
will assume as a matter of right the power to establish their own
elected regional bodies to run services where such co-operation with
other communities may be needed such as specialist hospitals, colleges,
police, radio and TV, transport, utilities, banking and investment. This
is a programme of liberation, a programme to get government off people's
backs and into their own hands. Such a political structure would at last
enable people's wishes to prevail on the issues of war, ecological
sanity and economic justice. Across the world people would insist on the
most rigorous controls on armaments production, where it was permitted
at all, and of associated scientific research. At last the questions of
war and peace would not be matters of power-brokering and diplomacy in
the hands of giant states but moral questions of right and wrong in the
hands of people. The centralization of power kills democracy, by
concentrating decision making beyond the reach of the average citizen.

the franchise, but again what is evident is an increasing decline of
citizen influence or capacity to control as giant political parties,
subject to their own highly centralized bureaucracies, ordain their
workings and their general policy direction. What emerges from this
process is not one in which the citizen is able to express preferences
which party or government then seeks to effect, rather it is a matter of
policy decisions by powerful centralized bodies to which the citizen has
no effective response except to assent. It is a process which gives
enormous powers of patronage to party leaders and even more to heads of
government and it is one quite incompatible with the spirit and practice
of the democratic ethos. Such patronage is a powerful weapon in the
hands of those who deploy it to secure subservience to their wishes
rather than concurrence with the wishes of the citizen.

Viewed in this light, political decentralization (being a process of
transferring decision making power and authority) becomes a strong
vehicle for championing local diversity and local autonomy. Through it,
local interests are articulated, and local socio-cultural systems are
strengthened. Decentralization provides a structural and
institutionalized venue through which local people can participate and
exert "more influence in the formulation and implementation of policies"
and the determination of their development in general.4 If it is taken
that democracy means the rule of the people, then political
decentralization, by facilitating participation of the people in
decision-making, promotes democracy.

The government is the root cause of civic disengagement

Papworth 95 (John, Senior Editor @ Ecologist + Founder of Fourth World
Review, Small is Powerful, "The Monster", page 4-5, 1995)

In posing such questions let us be clear how the argument is shaping. We
are noting that society at large is afflicted with an increasing number
of problems in almost every aspect of its affairs; we are suggesting
that these problems taken together point to a general cause or causes
from which they stem and that one aspect of those causes relates to the
fact that our affairs are conducted on a mass basis rather than on a
localised, empowered community basis. We are also saying that the mere
existence of the mass form of society affirms the existence of a
majority which is ignorant of any serious consideration of its problems
and which is for the most part indifferent to any need to resolve them,
and that this mass unconcern is the material which dominant forces are
able to manipulate to achieve ends which are sharply at variance with
the general interests of society; in so doing they are prompting
governments to pursue courses which cannot fail to multiply problem
areas which, in turn prompts the emergence of protest or reform groups
of people who are informed, who do care about the general well-being of
society and who, in empowered communities, as distinct from the mass
form of society, would be the natural leaders who would be harkened to
and followed by their neighbours. To this it needs to be added that the
problems which now beset our societies are so numerous, as well as
enormous, as to constitute an overall crisis of a magnitude which is no
only causing the everyday workings of the social order to malfunction
but which now threatens its prospects of survival as the sedulous
process of social disintegration which is thus created gathers momentum.

A mass democracy is an oxymoron. As the size of a political unit
increases the moral judgement of each of its members because
unimportant.

In terms of democratic comprehension power entities such as 'India', the
'USA', 'China', 'Russia', 'Germany', 'France', 'Britain' etc. are simply
a repudiation of any possibility of democratic practice. 'Democracy' is
a moral concept implying a condition of human freedom, and morality in
turn is wholly a function of human relationships, which is why the
numbers of humans involved in asserting and upholding moral principles
is all important. Numbers of a size that enables each person's moral
judgement and decision to be significant must be limited if such
decisions are to be operative. The mere existence of giant multi-million
states, especially when power is concentrated in single centres, is an
effective repudiation of any possibility of democratic practice. A mass
democracy is an oxymoron. The centralization of power ensures that
economic interests will triumph over those of the individual, killing
democracy Papworth, Senior editor of the Ecologist and founder of the
Fourth World Review, 01, (John, The Fourth World Review, The Community
Revolution. Nos 109 &110) Radical activists really must wake up here.
The sheer scale and degree of centralised power of most governments puts
them effectively beyond the reach of any prospect of citizen control;
but governments are not, in any case, any longer masters of their own
house. That office is now decisively in the hands of a mere score or so
of globally operating boardrooms. In this light, however commendable it
may be for radical activists to stage street protests or to petition
governments to remedy this or that abuse, there is a need, more urgent
than ever before, to define what we are protesting for and the kind of
world we are seeking in which to live, one which rejects greed for
profit or power as a motivating principle and one which restores power
to the people. It is an objective which must imperatively reject any
form of mass organisation, precisely the form which has robbed people of
power and enabled boardroom greed to achieve its dominance; it is one
that commands imperatively a human-scale approach, one which enables
personal decision-making again to become meaningful and vibrant.
Revolutionary politics today is community politics, and its weapons are
not guns and violence but clarity of thought and ever persistent
peaceful persuasion.

The Ludwig von Mises Institute. 3-18-04. <http://mises.org/story/1471>)

The well-known inefficiencies of government operation are not empirical
accidents, resulting perhaps from the lack of a civil-service tradition.
They are inherent in all government enterprise, and the excessive demand
fomented by free and other underpriced services is just one of the many
reasons for this condition. Thus, free supply not only subsidizes the
users at the expense of nonusing taxpayers; it also misallocates
resources by failing to supply the service where it is most needed. The
same is true, to a lesser extent, wherever the price is under the
free-market price. On the free market, consumers can dictate the pricing
and thereby assure the best allocation of productive resources to supply
their wants. In a government enterprise, this cannot be done. Let us
take again the case of the free service. Since there is no pricing, and
therefore no exclusion of submarginal uses, there is no way that
government, even if it wanted to, could allocate its services to the
most important uses and to the most eager buyers. All buyers, all uses,
are artificially kept on the same plane. As a result, the most important
uses will be slighted, and the government is faced with insuperable
allocation problems, which it cannot solve even to its own satisfaction.
Thus, the government will be confronted with the problem: Should we
build a road in place A or place B? There is no rational way by which it
can make this decision.

## Healthcare is the epitome of overcentralization. It\'s current practice denies the power of local communities, whilst sacrificing quality healthcare for profits.  {#healthcare-is-the-epitome-of-overcentralization.-its-current-practice-denies-the-power-of-local-communities-whilst-sacrificing-quality-healthcare-for-profits. .Tags}

A further factor here is the role of drugs and drug companies in a
national service. One medical authority has declared that \'In Europe
and the USA the drug companies now control the medical profession. To a
large extent doctors have become the marketing arms of the
pharmaceutical industry. The same author asserts many widely used drugs
are dangerous and often do more harm than healing. What stands out is
that most drugs are excessively overpriced and that their cost, as well
as the costs of medical equipment and mundane ancillary items such as
bandages, plays a quite disproportionate role in health care budgets. A
local health service would be free to break out of the current
constraints imposed by giant drug companies. Local labour could be
employed to make equipment and such items as bandages at a fraction of
the prevailing charges, and the way would also be open to employ natural
traditional remedies from local services such as herb gardens. There is
a pronounced tendency to dismiss remedies based on natural ingredients
as being so much hocus pocus; it is an attitude which ignores how much
more hocus pocus there is in the promotion of high powered products of
the giant pharmaceutical companies. The size of their advertising
budgets is a key pointer here; the whole emphasis of the industry is not
on healing but in making money, often in ways which are none too
scrupulous with regard to the long term effects of repeated use. What is
noticeable about a national service is its disregard of positive health
promotion. It is really a National Sickness service. Very few people
have any detailed understanding of how their bodies work and are
generally ignorant of the needs of their respiratory, digestive,
excretory and other organs; it is this ignorance which enables
advertisers to persuade them to purchase highly flavoured, devitalised
and chemicalised items masquerading as food on such a regular basis as
to make one form of ill health or another inevitable. Most of the
shelves in most food stores today are institutionalised assaults on any
attempt to provide a proper health service; a locally run service would
be aware of the relationship between this factor and the effect on its
health budget and be concerned to promote locally-produced chemical-free
food and to make people aware of the true conditions of bodily health.
Helping people to understand you cannot buy good health, you can only
Jive it, and a genuinely democratic local health authority would be a
front runner in promoting the ways decent health can be attained. It may
well be asserted, indeed it frequently is, that village people are apt
to make mistakes with their limited knowledge and that these can carry a
heavy cost in terms of both money and resources, mistakes which experts
with their greater knowledge can avoid. this of course is only too true.
Inadequate supervision of local building operations may prompt a
contractor to install drainage pipes of smaller than specified
dimensions, or to use sub-standard construction materials and so on,
practices which only come to light after a lapse of time and when
invoices have been finally processed.

The centralization of power inevitably trades off with local power and
results in gross inefficiency and a destruction of the value of life,
turning case.

And the damage the boardroom brigands have done to work is reflected in
what the politicians have done to our social structures. Local
government once involved the energies, dedication, commitment and
genuinely altruistic spirit of service to the community of a high
proportion of local people.  Today a kind of Fabian fascism has brushed
all this aside as being of no account. Instead of members of a local
community hospital or welfare committee being involved in the day-to-day
running of local institutions, organising fetes and celebrations to
raise funds and keeping the show on the road; doing it in ways which
gave their lives meaning, status and, again that word, fulfilment, they
are now relegated to the role of voting fodder in the mass political
charade. We now have \'national\' schemes and ministries for health,
education, welfare and other essentially local matters.  The evidence
abounds and grows that these bodies are increasingly wasteful and
inefficient, where they are not indeed riddled with the maggot of
corruption, and not least of course they operate on organisational
parameters which make a mockery of democratic principle.  Somehow the
illusion has been fostered, for example, that people who have devoted
their lives to clambering to the top of the greasy pole are better
qualified to ordain how children should be educated than are the parents
and their local committees. So our public prints are loaded with otiose
speculation about \'national\' examination standards and results, and
about the content of \'national\' educational curricula; meanwhile, in
rural areas, large numbers of children are bussed to giant
\'comprehensive\' schools where they learn about computers and nothing
about how to grow food. Local government, instead of being a power in
its own right but working in tandem, where necessary, with national
government, is now the pawn of the latter, which is making a mess of the
whole works.

A tennis club member can communicate on the club's concerns with his
fellow club member, perhaps in the club room bar or on its notice board;
multi-million members of an electorate are dependent on communicating on
their common concerns, if at all, through mass newspapers or TV
programmes. But the power of such communication is not in the members'
hands, it is in the hands of those who own or control such means. On the
basis of the personal nature of the relationships that prevail, the club
member is in a position to exercise a significant measure of influence
on its policies and programmes, the ordinary member of a mass electorate
has none: If, by excessive wealth or talents, or of oratory or
authorship, he can exercise significant influence he is not an ordinary
member. In the tennis club the natural leaders and spokespersons
communicate with their fellow members by the ordinary force of moral
suasion, the member the mass is not a communicator to any significant
degree at all, he is a recipient. This means that the moral force of his
views inevitably becomes at a discount since they are subservient to the
governing, determining and manipulating forces at the centre. These
forces control the levers of power in the pursuit of money or power
concerns which may be, as commonly they are, at variance with the
interests of the citizen or indeed the basic moral concerns of
civilisation. The moral implications of this, however carefully
disregarded, are frightening; such moral force as may be given
leadership in the tennis club will naturally appeal to what is best in
people. Where mass leadership may be at stake it can only do so
successfully by appealing to the most general propensity; the proportion
of the highest common factor gives way to the promotion of the lowest
common denominator. The mass society becomes inevitably an embodiment of
institutionalised vulgarity. The aff can\'t solve without the
alternative. All reform movements are doomed fail so long as
governmental power remains centralizaed. Papworth 5 -- ( John, Senior
editor of the Ecologist, baker, and founder of the Fourth World Review,
Village Democracy) For generations the reformist agenda of policy change
has held the stage on the assumption that if enough support can be
garnered it will impel the necessary policy changes, meanwhile the
general crisis of our civilisation has continued to deepen until today
it overshadows the entire human adventure. The reformist agenda, whether
for peace, for economic sanity or for much needed changes on many
pressing problems is simply a diversion from the guts of the problem.
That agenda has failed, and that failure stems from a single cause, that
the scale of government or of economic activity has become so large as
to be beyond any citizen capacity to exercise the control needed to make
it work for the general interest. If we are serious about the need for
change we need to recognise the sheer irrelevance of postulating
high-minded moral goals when there is no form of power available to
achieve them. We need to create those new forms of power, forms which
put power where in democratic terms it belongs, in the hands of
concerned citizens. The modern experience, and much ancient wisdom, is
eloquent that for democratic power to be effective it must be locally
based in local community hands. To that goal all serious political
effort needs to be directed if moves for change are to have any prospect
of success.

The largely unconscious biological mechanisms, which control numbers in
the animal world were also operative in human societies until quite
recent times. They operated on the basis of decisions made consensually
(and frequently instinctively) in small groupings. Today there is a need
for those responses to be reinforced by a conscious process of
reasoning; instead we have largely destroyed the small communities,
which were their basis. This is the real cause of the population crisis.
No small self-governing community threatened to be swamped by its own
numbers would fail to do something to prevent it if it had the power to
do so. We declare that the need for base power in our village societies
is imperative if the crisis in human numbers is to be resolved. No
government of a mass society can solve this problem except by means,
which are totalitarian and an assault on human dignity. Community
responsibility for community affairs is a precondition for the control
of community numbers. It follows that community power is a precondition
for community survival.

To draw up a plan or a blueprint for the creation of a humanscale
non-centralised global order would be as foolish as it would be futile.
If the principle of the human scale is accepted then clearly each human
scale community will be concerned to work out its own way of life, in
accordance with its own judgements. Any suggestion of acting in
accordance with a centralised plan would be the extension of a disease
rather than the application of a remedy. People will only act in
accordance with a principle if they understand and accept the principle
itself and to that end a major and multifaceted drive to educate and to
generally promote the principle of the human scale is now a task of the
utmost urgency. While small communities might take sometimes take
reprehensible action, their limited size ensures that the scope of
negative action will be limited, but the positive action\'s is not.

a tragic failure here to grasp some quite elementary factors relating to
the political process; that, for example, affairs conducted on a small
scale may well produce small-scale horrors, whereas when conducted on a
giant scale they produce giant horrors. There is an equal failure to
grasp that when affairs are conducted on a small, local scale they are
capable of producing, as indeed they have done, glory unlimited in every
sphere of human creativity, whereas on a giant, mass scale, the chief
orientation of modern life of the last century or more, we have produced
the first ugly civilisation in the human record.

Two questions arise here; how can the media avoid using its immense
power to cultivate and project the values which sustain its overall
quest? How can it avoid conditioning the public consciousness to accept
the mores of profit-seeking as a supreme social objective? Life in
modern so called developed societies is dominated by the continuous and
highly skilled propaganda of advertising in its promotion of an
exaggerated emphasis on the acquisition of material goods, and the use
of such services as travel, as an ultimate purpose of living. It does
this regardless of the social consequences or indeed of any other
consequences except its own enrichment. So the non-stop promotion of car
ownership will ignore the effects on global warming, its effects on
distorting and often destroying social relationships and community
structures, on family life, on the deliberate run-down of finite
resources such as oil and the consequent impoverishment of future
generations, on the high rate of accidents;2 on the distortion of
priorities in relation to public rail services, the extension of the
working day by car commuting, with its concomitant of stress of mind and
body and, not least, the perpetual ordeal of noise, stink and poisoned
air suffered by millions who live alongside busy urban roads.

I found Jonah Goldberg's follow-up contribution particularly
interesting. He points out that much of what was wrong with the
progressive movement of the early 20th century was due to its
infatuation with centralizing institutions that were ascendant at the
time: the army, heavy industry, and later, large-scale scientific
endeavors like the Manhattan Project. Bigness and centralization were
in, and intellectuals believed that the entire country should be
governed in a similarly hierarchical fashion. Goldberg thinks liberals
will just discard the economic argument for central planning and move on
to another one: public health, the environment, whatever. But I wanted
to point out that there are also some liberals who are adopting a more
appropriately skeptical attitude toward central planning itself. [One
reason to think the 21st century is going to be more libertarian than

According to Franz Hinkelammert, the West has repeatedly been under the
illusion that it should try to save humanity by destroying part of it.
This is a salvific and sacrificial destruction, committed in the name of
the need to radically materialize all the possibilities opened up by a
given social and political reality over which it is supposed to have
total power. This is how it was in colonialism, with the genocide of
indigenous peoples, and the African slaves. This is how it was in the
period of imperialist struggles, which caused millions of deaths in two
world wars and many other colonial wars. This is how it was in
Stalinism, with the Gulag and in Nazism, with the holocaust. **And now
today, this is how it is in neoliberalism, with the collective sacrifice
of the periphery and even the semiperiphery of the world system**. With
the war against Iraq, it is fitting to ask whether what is in progress
is a new genocidal and sacrificial illusion, and what its scope might
be. It is above all appropriate to ask if the new illusion will not
herald the radicalization and the ultimate perversion of the western
illusion: destroying all of humanity in the illusion of saving it

Welfare reform has been marked by a downward transfer of decisionmaking
power regarding the content and administration of welfare policy from
federal, to state and local governments as well as the private sector
(devolution). With this change has also come a shift in the level at
which services themselves are provided, such that for- and
not-for-profit organizations as well as ''faith-based'' groups now
compete with the public sector for funds (Boyer, Lawrence and Wilson
2001). Devolution expresses the goals of a broader neoliberal agenda by
enabling both inter-locality competition and, especially, privatization.
By transferring some of the responsibilities that were once under the
auspices of the federal government downward and outward to the private
sector, devolution can be seen as an expression of ''hollowing out''
some of the responsibilities of the federal government under
neoliberalism described by Jessop (1999).

We are nonetheless faced with considering both the tensions and
possibilities devolution portends for the discipline: to reflect it
uncritically as an exercise in the technocratic pragmatism of the
neo-liberal agenda is one possibility, or to engage with it as part of
the 'expanding the social policy imaginary' approach (Lewis, 2000). We
contend that devolution represents a potential paradigmatic shift for
the discipline if we engage with it as a new dimension in the
'rethinking' story of contestation, conflicts and struggles over welfare
arrangements, delivery and outcomes, through the forging of new arenas
of analysis, new methodologies and concepts in a multi-nation,
neo-liberal UK.

First, local states are left with less control to position themselves
within a volatile global economy, even as the national stale passes off
addi­tional responsibility for them to attempt this (Peck *&* Tickell,
1994\>. Devolution of the national state does open new \"regulatory
spates\" for local initiative, and «the geographic consequences of this
particular mode of restructuring will reflect the relative capacities of
local states to respond, as discussed above. But these regulatory spaces
will be con­strained in all places by competitive pressures imposed by
global capital and reinforced by neoliberalism in the national slate
(Peck, 1993). The accelerating global mobility of capital accentuates
fine distinctions between place\* (Harvey. 1989) and exerts \"economic
discipline^-^ on locale\* to conform to its demands (Harvey. 1985). The
ensuing rivalry for investment among local states will require reducing
the regulatory role previously played by government, while the taxes
that underwrite governmental assistance will he kept to a minimum to
ensure the area\'s boundaries. *National stales* increasingly operate
within a global econ­omy that they are unable to control (Clark *&* Dear,
1984) as nation-based fordist production, regulated by the Keynesian
welfare stale, yields to globally extensive posttordisr production,
emancipated through deregulation by the neoliberal state (Jessop. 1»3;
Peck *&* Tickell, 1994). The neoliberal restructuring of the national
slate, taking the particular forms of devolution and privatization in
the United Slates, passes greater responsibility onto *heal states,*
which are even less capable of exerting power within a globalized
economy. Finally, despite the prospect of migration for some
individuals, *civil society* remains the most place-bound and locally
dependent- due to material, familial, and emotional tics to community
(Bey non *&* Hudson, 1993; Cox & Mair. 1988). David Harvey (1989) nails
the point; \"Labor power has to go home every night\" (p. 19) These
interconnected trends---globalization of capital, devolution and
privatization of the state, and localization of civil soci­ety---shift
power increasingly toward capital (Offe. 1985; Peck, 1995; Storper *&*
Walker, 1989), an asymmetrical power relation termed \"glo-calization\"

In spite of the benefits devolution might offer as a ''laboratory for
policy innovation'' at the state level, there are concerns about the
potential for the downward transfer of decision-making power to
intensify inequality of access to opportunity between different places
(Cashin 1999; Karger 1991). Benefit levels vary widely between states,
and are not calibrated to cost-of-living differences between states or
between different areas within a state. We also find considerable
unevenness in what it means to be on welfare from state to state. As
research from the Applied Research Center suggests, as of 2001 welfare
recipients in Minnesota were allowed to earn wages to supplement cash
benefits, while clients in California were sanctioned and even
imprisoned for doing the same (Gordon 2001). In this sense devolution is
of a piece with neoliberal polices and practices which work to ''fix''
disenfranchised peoples in place to their detriment. According to Andrew
Herod and Melissa Wright, such policies: localize poor peoples at a
supposed time of growing planetary spatial integration of capital flows,
goods and services, information, and wealthy people. Apparently, despite
the one-world rhetoric of neoliberalism, some people face tremendous
obstacles in linking their worlds and becoming fully-fledged citizens of
the ''global village'' about which we hear so much (Herod and Wright
2002:12) **These critiques suggest that devolution has the potential to
exacerbate, rather than redress, gendered, racialized, and place-based
disparities in access to social and economic opportunity.**

The 1996 welfare law raises additional questions about our commitment to

making it more difficult for poor families---or groups that represent
them--- to have a role in shaping the policies that most affect them if,
in fact, it is harder for them to participate effectively in the states
and localities than in the nation\'s capital. Americans commonly support
the idea that parents should have a voice in education policy, old
people should have influence on the shape of Medicare and Social
Security, and business organizations should effectively express their
views about regulation. These groups may not always get what they want,
but it is regarded as entirely legitimate---in fact, necessary---that
they have a role in the policymaking process in our pluralist system. If
the effect of devolution, however, is to send welfare policymaking to
political spheres where representatives of poor families are weakest, it
will further diminish their political voice.

**Peck, phD at University of Manchester, 2001**

The political implications of this are nontrivial. While the politics of
workfare advocacy have assumed an increasingly aggressive, generic, and
transnational form, for the most part anti-workfare politics remain
de­fensive, particularized, and localized. Indeed, explicit objectives
around the weakening, division, and localization of sources of political
opposi­tion are often reflected in welfare-restructuring strategies. It
seems that once the national defenses of welfarism have been breached,
the path is opened decisively to downscale residual welfare and emergent
workfare functions. This involves reregulation not only at the state and
local scales but also at that of the individual bodies of welfare
recipients---given the preoccupation in U.S. reforms, for example, with
regulating the repro­ductive as well as the productive lives of welfare
recipients, through such measures as the denial of aid to teen parents,
\"man in the house\" rules, leamfare, family caps, and so forth. This
downloading of risks and regu­lator)\' responsibilities to the level of
the individual is also evident in workfares labor-regulatory functions,
because as the epitome of supply-side policymaking it seeks to make a
virtue of individualized, \"flexible\" labor relations. The ideology
that frames these programs, indeed, is rooted in the notion of
independence through wage labor.

Americans do not appear to think a great deal about poor people, and
when they do, it often is with pity or disapproval. Neither, how­ever,
are Americans in general likely to be entirely comfortable with the
prospect that in a range of jurisdictions the perspectives of low-income
fam­ilies may have virtually no influence on the design of policies that
are vital to their well-being.\"

The mainsireaming of workfarist discourse and practice, of course,

is typically more incremental and more complex. The course of workfare
politics has run differently in Canada, the United States, and the
United Kingdom, as powerful legacies of path-dependency remain alongside
re­vealing convergences in rhetoric and practice. So this is not, nor is
it ever likely to be, a story of simple convergence toward a unitary
workfarist model, but an uneven process of mutually referential
adjustment. In this context, PRWORA retains a talismanic significance,
as a truly radical mo­ment of reform. As Rodgers (2000: 5) puts it,
\"PRWORA completely changes the philosophy of welfare policy.\" While
this may understate some important continuities with past U.S. practice,
it quite correctly draws attention to the potentially phase-shifting
consequences of work enforcement by way of devolution to the states. The
variegated and com­petitive local reform dynamic that this entails
threatens to leave the postwelfare United States in a perpetual state of
destabilization and ex­perimentation. This, in turn, facilitates a
continuation of the cafeteria-style reform process established under the
waiver regime, broadening and deepening the workfarist repertoire and
creating the basis for further rounds of fast-policy transfers.
Facilitated by an increasingly techno­cratic and essentialist evaluation
literature, plus the earnest endeavors of consultants, this fast-policy
regime has taken on an international---and in an important sense
interlocal---character (see Jessop and Peck, 2000; Peck and Theodore,
2001).

There is an important sense, then, in which local political struggles
usually reflect---though are not determined by---the local form of
work-fare strategies. Where workfare slots are located in the public
sector, the strategy is exposed to the threat of unionization; where
workfare relies on nonprofit-sector placements, then the obvious line of
resistance is to choke off the supply of places through social-sector
campaigning and lobbying; where workfare is oriented to wage employment
in the exter­nal labor market---in many ways its tendential
form---resistance is ren­dered difficult due to the diffuse and
individualized nature of this strat­egy, but may take the form of
boycotts, unionization drives, or research-based campaigns. At the very
least, different workfare strategies call for different forms of local
political response; they are also differentially vul­nerable to
disruption, reform, and implementation failure at the local level,
depending on their (inherently unpredictable) interactions with lo­cal
political, economic, and institutional structures. And, of course, the
geography of oppositional politics also reflects the uneven terrain of
preexising political forces and resources at the local level. In
Baltimore, for example, responses to workfare have been shaped by
previous pat­terns of activism around the city\'s \"Living Wage\"
campaign.

Society" edited by Lynn A. Staeheli, Janet E. Kodras, and Colin Flint,

Devolution refers to the transfer, or decentralization, of government
functions from higher to lower levels of the federal hierarchy. As a
transformation internal to the state that alters the scale of
activities, devolution redefines government responsibilities for
regulating civil society, transfers authority across levels and
administrative units of government, redraws the map of government costs
and benefits, and changes accessibility and entitlement to government
services. In shift­ing responsibilities and resources to lower tiers in
the federal hierarchy, the national government still retains authority
to set the direction for change, as \"this complex subnational
reconstitution of state power and regulatory structures is occurring
within a set of political, discursive, and institutional parameters
established by (or mediated by) the nation-state\" (Peck, 1996, p. 3).
Devolution is an inherently spatial process of state change---first,
because the American federal structure is a hierar­chical organization of
territorially demarcated governments, and sec­ond, because the uneven
development of different local states generates dissimilar initiatives
in response to devolution according to local needs, perceptions, and
abilities.

Big government actually never went away, but certainly it has become
\'more clearly evident in recent years, especially since September 11,
2001.\' The various military and legal projects for global security led
primarily by the United States since that date, for example, are
oriented in part toward stabilizing and guaranteeing the global economic
order. In some respects, after September 11 the private forms of
authority over the global economy, such as the new *Lex mercatona,*
along with all the mechanisms or international trade and the
macroeconomic equilibria that.make them possi-, J\>le, went into crisis.
The dominant nation-states had to intervene to guarantee all levels of
economic interactions---financial transactions, in­surance relationships,
air transportation, and so forth. The crisis gave a quick reminder of
just how much capital needs a sovereign authority standing behind it, a
truth that rises up into view every time there are seri­ous cracks in the
market order and hierarchy. The big government that guarantees market
order must be in pan a military power. Capital occasionally has to call
on an army to force open unwilling markets and stabilize existing ones.
In the early nineteenth cen­tury, for example, British capital needed the
British military to open up the Chinese market with its victory in the
Opium *\'War.* This is not to say, however, that all military actions
are explained by specific economic inter­ests. It is not adequate to
think, for example, that the U.S.-led military ac-i dons in recent
decades---Afghanistan and Iraq, much less Somalia, Haiti, and
Panama---were primarily directed at a specific economic advantage, such
as access to cheap oil. Such specific goals are secondary. The primary
link between military action and economic interest exists only at a much
more general level of analysis, abstract from any particular national
inter­est. Military force must guarantee the conditions for the
functioning of the world market, guaranteeing, that is, the divisions of
labor and power of the global political body. This effort is
paradoxical, however, because the relationship between security and
profits cuts two ways. On one hand, the de­ployment of state military
power is necessary to guarantee the security of the global markets but,
on the other hand, the security regimes tend to raise national borders
and obstruct the global circuits of production and trade that had been
the basis of some of the greatest profits. The United States and other
military powers must discover a way to make the interests of security
and economic profits compatible and complementary. We should be clear
that the newly prominent need for a big govern­ment to support the
economy, especially since September 11, does not rep­resent in any way a
return to Keyncsianism. Under Keynesianism the nation-state supported
the stability and growth of the economy by provid­ing mechanisms to
mediate the conflicts and interests of the working class and in the
process expanded the social demand for production. The forms of
sovereignty we see now, on the contrary, reside completely on the side
of capital without any mediatory mechanisms to negotiate its conflictual
relationship with labor. It is interesting in this regard how ambivalent
the position of capital is when risk is the dominant characteristic of
economic activity and development, and indeed of all social interaction.
The world is a dangerous place, and the role of big government and
military inter­vention is to reduce risks and provide security while
maintaining the pres­ent order.\> / W ? ^8^

## **Neoliberalism makes poverty inevitable** {#neoliberalism-makes-poverty-inevitable .Tags}

(Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, "Multitude", NM, p.277-280)

After recognizing the extent of poverty in the world today, one has to
recognize also its uneven geographical distribution. In each
nation-state, poverty is distributed unequally along lines of race,
ethnicity, and gender. In many countries throughout the world, for
example, there are signifi­cantly higher rates of poverty among women
than men, and many ethnic minorities, such as the indigenous populations
throughout the Americas, have significantly higher rates of poverty.
Local and national variations in the rate of poverty, however, are
dwarfed by the inequalities of wealth and Dovcrtv on a global scale.
South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa account for about 70 percent of the
global population living on less than a dollar a day, up from about 60
percent ten yean ago. The average income of the richest 20 countries is
thirty-seven times greater than the average in the poorest twenty---a
gap that has doubled in the past forty years.^68^ Even when these
figures are adjusted for purchasing power---since some basic commodities
cost more in rich countries than in poor---the gap is aston­ishing. The
construction of the global market and the global integration of the
national economies has not brought us together but driven us apart,
exacerbating the plight of the poor. There are millions of specific
expressions across the world of indigna­tion and generosity with respect
to die poor, often through courageous \^crs of charity and
self-sacrifice. Nonprofit, and religious charity organiza­tions provide
enormous assistance for those in need, but they cannot •change the
system that produces and reproduces poverty. It is impressive, in fact,
how so many people who begin in volunteer charity work pass to activism
and protest against the economic system.fry. Some protests against the
systemic reproduction of poverty, such as the Jubilee Movement
International, focus on the fact that foreign debt obli­gations serve as
a mechanism that keeps the poor countries poor and their populations
hungry.^69^ It is clear that no matter what economic policies they enact
the poorest countries cannot repay their current foreign debts or even
keep up with interest payments, perpetuating an inescapable cycle of
misery. Furthermore, many claim that these debts were incurred
origi­nally through dubious or illegitimate means. It is always the same
story: debt serves as a legal mechanism of enslavement.^70^ The
difference here is ■ that this logic of bondage is applied not merely to
the individual inden­tured worker or even to a specific racial group or
indigenous population (where the assumption of a civilizing mission is
the basis of debt) but rather to entire nations. ^;^ In more general
terms many economic grievances against the global system arc based on
the assumption that the inequalities and injustices of the global
economy result primarily from the fact that political powers are less
and less able to regulate economic activity. Global capital, the
argu­ment goes, since its movement and reach extend well beyond the
limits of national space, cannot be effectively controlled by states.
Many labor unions, particularly in the dominant countries, protest the
fact that the mere threat of the mobility of capital---die threat, for
example, of moving production and jobs to another country where state
regulations anoVor la­bor costs are lower and more favorable---can
convince states to abandon or temper their own regulatory powers. States
conform to and even anticipate the needs of capital for fear of being
subordinated in the global economic system. This creates a son of race
to the bottom among nation-states in which the interests of labor and
society as a whole take a backseat to those of capital. Neoliberalisrn
is generally the name given to this form of state economic policy.
Neoliberalism, as we claimed in part 2, is not really a regime of
unregulated capital but rather a form of state regulator that best
facilitates the global movements and profit of capital. Once again in
the era of neoliberalism, it might be helpful to think of the state as
the executive committee assigned the task of guaranteeing the long-term
well-bring of \"collective capital The fundamental task of the
neoliberal state, fron this perspective, like all forms of the
capitalist state, Is to regulate \"capitalist development in the
interest of global capital itself.

There may be considerable disagreement as to the extent to which
devolution represents a significant departure in terms of divergent
policymaking. It is a simple enough task to point to policy differences
such as free personal care for the sick and elderly or the student fees
policy in Scotland, or free prescriptions and the abolition of school
league tables in Wales. Some would argue the differences are marginal to
the overarching continuities ensured by Labour-dominated administrations
(at least prior to the May 2007 elections) across the devolved polities,
and the quiet manipulation of the policy strings by civil servants in
Whitehall (Hudson and Lowe, 2004). It is clearly important to view
devolution within the context of the New Labour 'modernising' project
and as a product of its wider socio-economic and neo-liberal agendas.
The devolved Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland are part of this
mission. However, it can be argued that the devolved nations open up new
sites of struggle and contestation, new processes and practices which
challenge the ideological and geo-political boundaries of the British
Welfare State, and this encapsulates a significant shift which impacts
on the central concerns of the discipline. Interestingly, Clarke,
writing within a transnational frame, draws our attention to these very
limits of neo-liberalism in practice as it forms an interface with
particular geopolitical and cultural entities, when he says this
philosophy may encounter 'diverse forms of resistance and refusals to
"go with the flow"'(2004: 9).

In any event, the political history of which the Framers were aware
tends to confirm that quite often [concentration of political power
ultimately leads to the loss of liberty]{.underline}. Indeed, if we have
begun to take the value of separation of powers for granted, we need
only look to modern American history to remind ourselves about both the
general vulnerability of representative government, and the direct
correlation between the concentration of political power and the threat
to individual liberty. The [widespread violations of individual
rights]{.underline} that [took place when President Lincoln assumed an
inordinate level of power]{.underline}, for example, are well
documented. [Arguably as egregious were the threats to basic freedoms
that arose during the Nixon administration]{.underline}, when the power
of the executive branch reached what are widely deemed to have been
intolerable levels. [Although in neither instance did the executive\'s
usurpations of power ultimately degenerate into complete and
irreversible tyranny, the reason for that may well have been the
resilience of our political traditions]{.underline}, among the most
important of which is separation of powers itself. In any event, [it
would be political folly to be overly smug about the security of either
representative government or individual liberty]{.underline}. Although
it would be all but impossible to create an empirical proof to
demonstrate that our constitutional tradition of separation of powers
has been an essential catalyst in the avoidance of tyranny, common sense
should tell us that the simultaneous division of power and the creation
of interbranch checking play important roles toward that end. To
underscore the point, [one need imagine only a limited modification of
the actual scenario surrounding]{.underline} [the]{.underline} recent
Persian [Gulf War]{.underline}. In actuality, the war was an extremely
popular endeavor, thought by many to be a politically and morally
justified exercise. But [imagine a situation in which a
President]{.underline}, concerned about his failure to resolve
significant social and economic problems at home, [has callously decided
to engage the nation in war, simply to defer public attention
from]{.underline} his [domestic failures]{.underline}. To be sure, the
President was presumably elected by a majority of the electorate, and
may have to stand for reelection in the future. However, at this
particular point in time, but for the system established by separation
of powers, [his authority]{.underline} as Commander in Chief to engage
the nation in war [would be effectively dictatorial. Because the
Constitution reserves to]{.underline} the arguably even more
representative and accountable [Congress the authority to declare war,
the Constitution has attempted to prevent such misuses of
power]{.underline} by the executive. It remains unproven whether any
governmental structure other than one based on a system of separation of
powers could avoid such harmful results. In summary, no defender of
separation of powers can prove with certitude that, [but for the
existence of separation of powers, tyranny would be the inevitable
outcome]{.underline}. But the question is whether we wish to take that
risk, given the obvious severity of the harm that might result.
[Given]{.underline} both the relatively limited cost imposed by use of
separation of powers and [the great severity of the harm sought to be
avoided, one should not demand a great showing of the likelihood that
the feared harm would result.]{.underline} For [just as in the case of
the threat of nuclear war, no one wants to be forced into the position
of saying, \"I told you so.\"]{.underline}

world destruction lodged in the discretion of one person. As a result of
public indignation aroused by the Vietnam disaster, in which tens of
thousands lost their lives in military actions initiated by a succession
of Presidents, Congress in 1973 adopted, despite presidential veto, the
War Powers Resolution. Congress finally asserted its checking and
balancing duties in relation to the making of presidential wars.
