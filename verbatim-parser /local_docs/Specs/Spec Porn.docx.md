Note that these are bullshit arguments. Each spec takes 25 sec. avg. to
read. If 9 specs are read, it takes about or 3.75 minutes to read them.
To answer a spec, \~35 seconds are devoted to the task. This takes the
aff \~5.25 minutes, leaving them with only 2.75 minutes to answer or
other args. Also, I don't think the aff has blocked out Death-Spec
answers or whatnot. The best part is: Dropped Spec=/=Insta WIN!1!1

# E-Spec 1NC

A.  Our interpretation of fiat is that it is an assumption we agree to
    make. We don't agree to aff assumptions that aren't topical nor to
    ones we can't debate against.

B.  They don't specify their enforcement- the plan may be civil or
    criminal with unknown detterents and actors. The aff has to present
    evidence about that to make a prime facie case.

C.  That's bad

<!-- -->

1.  We lose ground, without enforcement specified we lose specific links
    to DA's, K's, and case which discuss how law works since 90 percent
    of the plan is in the implementation.

2.  They're effectively fiating the object. If they don't tell us what
    happens in the case someone doesn't obey the plan it gives us the
    same ground as if we simply assumed to plan solves, which destroys
    negative ground since we can't make solvency arguments so our
    strategy has to be based on impact turns which makes the neg lose
    against cases that ban racism or they have to run tricky CPs.

3.  They don't justify the resolution since they also ask we assume in
    the world follows the plan as a precondition to it being a good
    idea, since that's extratopical and proves the resolution is
    insufficient since federal actions isn't enough and it's
    unpredictable for the neg.

D.  Vote Neg

1.  They fail to affirm the resolution since they prove it alone isn't
    enough

2.  Voting aff deprives us of neg ground and kills fairness and
    education

#  Fiat Spec 1NC

A. Interpretation: The Affirmative must specify whether their plan goes
through normal means or is "magic wand" fiat.

B. Violation: The Affirmative doesn't specify what kind of fiat they are
using.

C. In-round Implications\
At best, this is a voter for fairness and education, as we lose Neg
ground, which is key to fairness, and that without specifying
implementation, education is lost due to hidden important facts. At
worst, it takes out solvency -- Without implementation, affirmative
solvency is dubious at best.

A. Interpretation: The aff must specify how their plan will be funded.

B. Violation: The aff doesn't specify their funding.

C. That's bad.

# Time-Spec

A. Interpretation: The aff must specify what time their plan will be
enacted.

B. Violation: The aff does not specify when their plan will be enacted.

C. That's bad.

1\. The aff can warp their plan to work in any time.

2\. Kills neg ground- We lose time-sensitive DA's and CP's, and all
uniqueness.

3\. It means no solvency. They can't solve within the timeframe that is
required to solve the

Harms before we all die.

D. Voter for education, competitive equity, and fairness. If you won't
look to the voters, you still have to look to the zero solvency.

# Death Spec

A. Interpretation: The aff must specify how people die from their harms

B. Violation: The aff fails to specify what kills people in their harms

C. That's bad

# G Spec 1nc

A. Interpretation- The grounds of a decision is as important as the
decision itself. The affirmative must specify it in the plan text

Frank H. **[Wu]{.underline}**, 20**[02]{.underline}**, a law professor
at Howard University Criminal Justice Magazine, "Profiling in the Wake
of September 11: The Precedent of the Japanese American Internment" Pg.
http://www.abanet.org/crimjust/cjmag/17-2/japanese.html

In that context, [the conclusion that the internment was wrong is not
enough. The reasons it was wrong must be articulated again. As lawyers
well know, the rationale may be as important as the result by itself in
comprehending the meaning of legal authority]{.underline}. What is
constitutional is not necessarily advisable. Technically, for all the
contempt directed at the Supreme Court's internment cases, it is worth
noting that the decisions have never been repudiated and actually have
been followed consistently. Indeed, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
penned a book a few years ago intimating that if a similar matter were
to come before the Court again he would not expect it do otherwise.
(William H. Rehnquist, All the Laws But One: Civil Liberties in Wartime
(Knopf 1998).) Imagining the counterfactual hypothetical of a Supreme
Court that struck down the internment, then, also entails supplying an
intellectual foundation. [There are multiple possibilities. They lead to
different outcomes in today's circumstances]{.underline}. If the
internment was wrong because racial classifications are to be regarded
as immoral or unconstitutional as an absolute rule, then there is no
distinction to be made between Japanese Americans on the one hand and
Arab Americans or Muslim Americans on the other hand. The form of the
argument does not vary by specific groups. If the internment was wrong
because the particular racial generalization was in the aggregate false,
then it may well be possible and appropriate to distinguish between the
Japanese Americans and Arab Americans or Muslim Americans. The premise
is that the conduct of Japanese Americans on the whole does not predict
the conduct of Arab Americans or Muslim Americans on the whole. There
are more possibilities. If the internment was wrong because of the lack
of any semblance of due process, then even the German Americans and
Italian Americans in isolated cases had their rights violated.
Individual Arabs and Muslims who are aliens may be entitled to more due
process than equal protection.

B. Violation: They fail to specify their grounds of a decision.

It's a voting issue for fairness :

1\. Failure to specify destroys alternate grounds counterplans and disad
links, they can switch their advocacy in the 2ac making the plan
conditional

2\. Understanding the grounds of the decision is the basis of all topic
specific education

# A-Spec

A. Interpretation -- power is divided among the 3 branches of government

Ronald D. Rotunda, Albert E. Jenner professor of law at the University
of Illinois, Summer 2001, "The Commerce Clause, The Politcal Question
Doctrine, And Morrison", Constitutional Commentary, 18 Const. Commentary
319, lexis

[The Framers of our Constitution]{.underline} anticipated that a
self-interested \"federal majority\" would consistently seek to impose
more federal control over the people and the states. n10 Hence, they
[created a federal structure designed to protect freedom by dispersing
and limiting federal power]{.underline}. They instituted federalism
\[\*321\] chiefly to protect individuals, that is, the people, not the
\"states qua states.\" n11 The Framers sought to protect liberty by
creating a central government of enumerated powers. [They]{.underline}
divided power between the state and federal governments, and they
further [divided power within the federal government by splitting it
among the three branches of government,]{.underline} and they further
divided the legislative power (the power that the Framers most feared)
by splitting it between two Houses of Congress. n12

B. Violation -- the Aff fails to specify the agent of action

C. Standards

1\. Ground -- the Aff is an incomplete policy without an agent --
specific case, DA, CP, and K ground is predicated on the agent

2\. Real world -- no policy can be established with an agent, since the
Government isn't a single entity -- this is a full solvency takeout --
vote neg on presumption

3\. Plan text key -- textual competition, lack of precise cross-ex, and
neg loses 1NC and pre-round prep are all reasons why the agent must be
in the plan

D. Voter for fairness and education

# O-Spec

A. Interpretation: The plan text must specify the United States Federal
Government.

B. Violation: The aff does not state the United States Federal
Government in their plan text.

C. Standards:

1\. Limits: Without using the United States Federal Government, the aff
could run any aff pertaining to a single branch of government, and the
neg could never prepare for the flood of new affs. Their plan justifies
plans that have something to do with a single person in Congress. This
kills topic specific education since we aren\'t talking about the
entirety of the government, but only a small piece of it.

2\. Ground: The neg loses ground since they can spike out of politics
DA\'s. It also justifies reading a seven minute plan text that doesn\'t
link to any arguments.

D. Voter for fairness and education.

#  M-Spec

A. Interpretation- The affirmative may not specify both the United
States Federal Government and an agent.\
B. Violation- The affirmative specifies both the USFG and an agent.\
It\'s a voting issue:\
1. Kills Neg ground. By specifying both the USFG and their agent, we
can\'t run A or O-spec. Specs are key to ensure a plan actually does
what it is supposed to do.\
2. Fiating multiple actors detracts from topic-specific education,
impossible for the neg to generate offense, and is infinitely
regressive.

# A2: 2AC clarification

Their clarification makes the whole situation worse.

1\. Plan text is key. If they clarify, we can't debate around a binding
text, which is the basis of the entire round. Clarification moots the
1nc and makes it impossible for neg to debate the aff since they can
just spike out of parts of our strategy. This is a voter for ground and
timeskew/fairness.

2\. Too little, too late- the damage has already been done, we based our
strategy off of what we heard in the 1AC and you have completely skewed
our time and strategy skew.

3\. Justifies aff conditionality- they can sever out of any part of
their plan to spike out of our disads- this destroys competitive equity.

4\. If they specify in the 2AC, it means they intended to be abusive --
make them pay for not putting it in their plan text or clarifying in CX,
they might have had a chance then, but now its game over on the abuse
story.

5\. Concedes they could have specified in their text-- the post facto
nature of their response means they could have easily specified in the
plan -- no risk of offense for the negative

# A2: Cross-X checks

Cross-ex does not check.

1\. It makes disclosure irrelevant; if the plan is really just explained
during cross-ex, their disclosure is misleading since we prep against
what they might say.

2\. It's infinitely regressive. They could read a meaningless plan text,
then clarify all of it during cross-ex, which gives the neg zero prep
until the end of the 1ac cross-ex.

3\. It's a bad standard for debate. Not everyone thinks that cross-ex is
binding, and partner miscommunication can substantially change the round
for either teams benefit, and there's no reason why it's better than 1ac
clarification.

4\. No one flows cross-ex. It's impossible to record specifications and
they may have different interpretations of what happened.

# A2: Normal Means

This doesn\'t help much, I don\'t know what \'normal\' means, we can\'t
prove this statistically because we need 2 variables to correlate and
they won\'t even give us one, we can\'t read evidence on il because the
plan has never been done, and the federal government doesn\'t have any
normal means - normal means just masks the fact that the plan doesn\'t
specify enforcement, that\'s worse because it\'s misleading to the neg

2 They\'re aff, it\'s their burden of proof to read cards on what the
plan would do, forcing us to evidence their case is infinitely
regressive

3 This is cosmically unpredictable, the aff could just as easily read
clarifications of normal means in the 2ac which is just as bad as 2ac
replanning and skews negative strategy and moots the 1nc because the 2ar
becomes the basis for negative strategy and that decreases education
because it\'s effectively a shorter debate

4 Normal Means is to specify enforcement, they clearly don\'t use normal
means

Armen H. **Merjian** Momber, New York and Connecticut Bars, Spring

Although the significance of this section is now well known, it is
unciear whether, in passing the Act, Congress fully appreciated its
scope. Section 504 was inconspicuously inserted into the Act rather late
in the process,

\"joined to three unrelated sections dealing with problems facing
handicapped people outside the specific context of rehabilitation
programs.\" n15 Perhaps as a result, it appears to have generated no
\[\*110\] controversy or debate in Congress n16 or among the general
public. n17 [As originally enacted, section 504 contained but a single
sentence, n18 with no indication of how its general pronouncement was to
be implemented and interpreted. n19 Unlike most legislation, and unlike
the other provisions of the Act itself, Congress did not provide for the
promulgation of implementing regulations for section 504. n20
Compounding this prob \[\*111\] lem, virtually no contemporaneous
legislative history exists with which to divine Congress\' intent in
passing section 504. n21]{.underline}

# A2: Optimal Means

It\'s not like we didn\'t notice the optimal means clause, it\'s just
that this specification tells us nothing.

2\. Our argument is that it\'s good to debate implementation, the only
justification for optimal means is that it protects the aff from abusive
args about implementation, but that presumes that they prove enforcement
doesn\'t matter. This arg is like a counter interpretation without any
standards for it.

3\. This gives us no ground, we don\'t know how the plan is enforced, so
we can\'t debate whether or not it happens.

4\. We aren\'t justifying bad counterplans, they can make theory
arguments against those CPs if someone runs them, there\'s no case turn
the aff shouldn\'t have to answer cuz that\'s most predictable and real
world to predicting the effects of policies

5\. Even if it were good for education to ignore implementation, that\'s
effectively object fiat cuz we can\'t make any case arguments so they
force us to run tricky CPs with impact turn strategies cuz we aren\'t
allowed to contest solvency - that turns all their reasons why bad CPs
are abusive cuz they would force us to run them

6\. Optimal means isn\'t topical both cuz it makes us assume actors
other than the federal government act and cuz optimal means could be
actors other than the federal government - those are two internal links
to the jurisdiction voter, the plan - no matter what a great idea it
is - doesn\'t warrant affirming the resolution so there\'s no reason to
vote aff

# A2: Leads to O-Spec

The argument is crap. It's the same as T is not a voter argument. Even
if we could run this violation on other cases, it wouldn't justify them
winning because no one would have to specify anything.

1\. It's easier for critics to ignore spec arguments if they think the
aff specifies enough, thus helping the aff, then it is for them to come
up with Spec arguments as a reason to vote neg. If we don't make the
argument, we can't win on it, but the aff can always win on the implicit
answer.

2\. In-round potential abuse comes first. As of the 2ac they could have
specified everything and we wouldn't have any relevant arguments for
their solvency which already warped the 1nc time allocation and strategy
since we didn't know what the plan did, which is the strategy skew
voter. We've got a more direct link to the terminal impact since their
hypothetical scenario relies on vapid perception internal links and a
snowball effect that assumes a super-informed community.

3\. Overspecifying is inevitable; as long as the affirmative has to say
anything, the neg can ask them more questions. If they don't have to
specify on, like, enforcement, a lot, they would still have to specify a
lot about something else, like intent, even as per their own
interpretation of the priorities of debate.

# A2: Your Cp doesn't spec.

This is a bit like an affirmative that gives food aid to secret
locations complaining that the neg won\'t say where the agent CP gives
the food, it\'s necessary to capture unclear parts of the aff -
otherwise the aff could just grill the aff on the details of the case
they don\'t know and then run vagueness, it makes it impossible to win a
neg ground against a case unless you know it better than the aff

2 The 1ac is the basis for the round, that we don\'t specify enforcement
is only a necessary precaution against new affirmative arguments about
how the plan works versus the CP

3 In the event that it is evr cleat how the plan is enforced, this is
how the CP works too, the negative needs flexibility to check aff
knowledge about the case and to run radical arguments that are untested
but might be very important.

4 Really no impact to neg enforcement specification cuz we don\'t have
to be topical and the aff is not entitled to ground the PIC is trying to
moot out, if we win that PICs are good then it isn\'t important for us
to defend our enforcement cuz the net benefit is more important and the
CP makes debate focus on that

5 CPs that don\'t specify encourage aff specification to generate
offense, if we win that specification is

good, that\'s offense for a vague CP

# A2: Reasonability

THIS ISN'T NAM -- THIS IS DEBATE, THERE ARE RULES

1\. It's not what you do it's what you justify -- competing
interpretations is the only non-arbitrary standard of evaluating abuse.

2\. Reasonability allows every case to be topical because every case
links to generic arguments like NATO, malthus and spark.

3\. It's a jurisdictional voting issue -- it's not within your
jurisdiction to vote for a non topical affirmative.

4\. Applied to any other argument in debate reasonability is silly --
you wouldn't say -- "well we don't quite outweigh your disad but we're
reaallllly close"

5\. No impact to substance crowd out -- topicality debates are good
because they increase critical thinking to determine what kind of topic
the aff justifies, and are key to small schools being able to compete.

# A2: Being a Spec Whore Bad

A: There is no abuse in running Specs. Specification is what checks for
abuse done within the Affirmative's plan.

B: Under the competing interpretations framework, if the negative
presents a better interpretation than the affirmative\'s (which the
affirmative does not meet), the negative wins. In other words, the
affirmative\'s burden is to meet the best interpretation in the round.
Also, under this framework, the negative is allowed to run as specs as
necessary to ensure that no abuse has been done.

C. Prefer this framework

1\. Specification is a way to check for abuse in the Affirmative's plan.

2\. This framework is used throughout the debate community.

3\. Running specs is very predictable. Almost every team will run them.

4\. It prevents the Aff from being lazy and not answer Specs, while
reading an abuse argument in place of it.

D. No abuse has been done

1\. The Negative is only requiring the aff to specify in their plan text
\_\_\_\_\_\_.

2\. No education has been lost. Specification checks that we are
focusing on policy, not on something that is completely irrelevant to
debate.

3\. Specs are fair. It is a very predictable argument, and the Aff
should be prepared to answer it.

E. No reverse voting issue.

# A2: Competing Interpretations Bad

Competing Interpretations is best --

1\. Not a race to the bottom -- Aff can just argue that our standards
are bad, as long as we win our interpretation is best, we have proved it
advantageous. Make them read offense to our interpretation.

2\. Education -- competing interpretations is key to accessing in-depth
grammatical debate over the meaning of the resolution in context based
on standards debates.

3\. Most objective -- only our paradigm can actually determine the
winner of the debate with complete neutrality by evaluating it based on
offense and defense instead of whether the judge thinks the affirmative
interpretation is accurate.

# A2: No Voter

1\. There is in round abuse -- by not specifying, we lose ground and
education that would be in a specific debate.

2\. Potential abuse is a voter -- prefer competing interpretations --
they must justify their world of debate.
