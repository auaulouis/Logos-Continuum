#   Agent Specification---1nc  {#agent-specification1nc .Block-Title}

A. Interpretation: The affirmative should specify the branch of
government that implement their plan

B. Violation: They don't

C. Vote Negative---

1.Kills CP ground. Lack of specification destroys agent CP ground, which
is core negative ground. Also key to in depth education about the
opportunity costs of agency implementation. This is critical civic
education and is a key internal link to all their educational claims

2\. Crushes solvency debates---no in-depth solvency debates about the
who, what, when, and hows of the plan. Some of these agencies are better
able to solve an aff than others.

3\. Lack of specification is severance---allows them to say not
us---allows them to jack our link grd to agency DA's that is core topic
ground and makes the plan a moving target. This jacks education and
fairness and makes debate boring---leaves us with statism args.

4\. Vote Neg on presumption---90% of solvency in specification of the
plan

Elmore 80

Richard Elmore, Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 94, No. 4 (Winter,
1979-1980), pp. 601-616

The emergence of implementation as a subject for policy analysis
coincides closely with the discovery by policy analysts that **decisions
are not self-executing**. Analysis of **policy choices matters very
little if the mechanism for implementing those choices is poorly
understood.** In answering the question, **\"What percentage of the work
of achieving a desired governmental action is done when the preferred
analytic alternative has been identified?\" Allison estimated that, in
the normal case, it was about 10 percent, leaving the remaining 90
percent in the realm of implementation.** Hence, in Nelson\'s terms,
\"the core of analysis of alternatives becomes the prediction of how
alternative organizational structures will behave over . .. time.\"6 But
the task of prediction is vastly complicated by the absence of a
coherent body of organizational theory, making it necessary to posit
several alternative models of organization.7

#  Overview  {#overview .Block-Title}

Well always win that we are entitled to core negative arguments---which
their lack of specification crushes---we will give you a list

CP-courts, congress, executive order, federal courts, military, JCS,
ONI, Pentagon, and other agency cp's

DA's---Politics, Judicial Activism, Court politics, Specific Armed Force
Overstretch DA's, Coast Guard DA's

And these are voting issues

Extend the Elmore evidence---that is 90% of solvency means EVEN IF they
prove that they don't HAVE to spec their agent ---specification is still
key to 90% of their solvency---any risk of a da is a reason to vote
negative

Prefer our list---it shows what they stop us from running---this is core
negative ground

ALSO, the internal link to competitive equity only goes in one
direction\--they can't prove how they increase negative ground only that
they decrease it---this is a unique link turn to all their offensive
education and ground claims-so even if the education debate is a wash
they can never win ANY competitive equity offense.

Star this argument---Process CPs and PX are key to protect negatives
against new affirmatives Without these arguments negatives would lose
every outround---you have to protect our neg ground and strat
flex---which outweighs the advantages to vague unpredictable plan
writing

# A2: CX Checks  {#a2-cx-checks .Block-Title}

1.  Most judges don't listen to CX

2.  Encourages vauge plan writing---means we have to spend all our time
    in Cross ex figuring out how the plan works instead of talking aobut
    the substance of the debate. If absolutely nothing else, we loose
    vital CX time figuring out a basic function of their plan that they
    should have brought up in their speech.

3.  Plan text is key---only way to stick you to an advocacy---otherwise
    the aff is a moving target and aff conditionality is always worse.

# A2: Overspec {#a2-overspec .Block-Title}

1.  Turn: Increase PIC grd--- over-specification ensures an increase PIC
    ground and PIC grd is key to negative ground

2.  Over-spec is better than under specification---even if we force you
    to spec the agency and other parts of your aff it only increase your
    chance of solvency and gives us all a chance at a unique form of
    debate education---the process of implementation.

3.  Over-spec is inevitable---K's prove that when you read the aff there
    every word you say is a form of specification. No unique offense.

4.  

# A2: USFG Counterinterp {#a2-usfg-counterinterp .Block-Title}

1.  Not real world---no policy is implemented by all three branches at
    the same time.

2.  Not an answer---Even if their interpretation is correct that the
    USFG is all three branches it doesn't change that fact that
    immigration policy is not implemented by the judiciary. Instead they
    have to prove that their use of a particular branch is key to
    solvency of the plan

3.  Crushes CP grd---Lack of specification crushes out ability to use
    one of those agents that is critical neg ground

4.  Crushes DA ground---means we can't run judicial activism, court
    stripping, congressional stripping or any other branch specific DA

#  A2: PICS bad  {#a2-pics-bad .Block-Title}

*Offense*:

1.  Make the aff defend their whole plan, they've had infinite prep to
    find what would best advantage them

2.  Depth better than breadth: Plan focus makes better debate on key
    issues of the topic

3.  Key to check extra-topical plan planks

4.  Forces better plan writing- they'll learn to defend against PIC's

5.  Education- Our literature proves that this is a legitimate option to
    learn about and its most real world, this is how congressmen propose
    policy;

    a.  Real world is key to education because it's the only thing that
        gets taken beyond each round and

    b.  education outweighs fairness because the rules were made to
        maximize education, if we find a way to increase education, we
        should restructure the rules

*Defense*:

1.  Most counterplans are PICS anyway: They use the same agent in the
    USFG and are enforced the same way.

2.  Details are not trivial details: Separation of powers, federalism,
    etc are the key to the country, not just random stuff

3.  Net benefits check abuse: part of the plan has a disad to
    it---defend it, turn the net benefit

4.  Aff chooses the ground for debate- They get the plan we get
    everything else.

5.  Not a reason we should lose: reject the counterplan, give us back
    that status quo

# A2: Agent CPs bad  {#a2-agent-cps-bad .Block-Title}

*The Offense...*

1.  Key to negative ground, half of all CP's run are agent CP's

2.  Cross apply the elmore evidence from the shell

3.  Gives the affirmative ground- They can run any DA's they have to our
    agent

4.  Makes the aff defend their plan, why would they specify
    \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ if we can't have a debate on it.

*The Defense...*

1.  Its predictable, they're constantly run and we didn't pick some
    obscure actor

2.  Lit checks abuse- There aren't many agencies that someone will
    advocate should do the plan

3.  Debate has changed. As topics got bigger, affs defended plans
    instead of the whole resolution, reciprocally, It's now only the
    negatives job to disprove the plan.

4.  Not a voter- Its an argument to reject the CP

#  A2: No Educational Benefit  {#a2-no-educational-benefit .Block-Title}

1.  Key to education---critical to policy making education because it
    allows policy makers to map and navigate organizations

# A2: No Abuse  {#a2-no-abuse .Block-Title}

1.  Strategy skew---lack of specification has already jacked the
    1nc---it forced us to run this argument instead of our sick agency
    tradeoff DA's

2.  Also crushes CP grd

3.  Finally its not about what you do---its what you justify---which is
    vague plan writing and death of policy debate

#  A2: Not a voting Issue  {#a2-not-a-voting-issue .Block-Title}

1.  3 Reasons to vote negative

<!-- -->

a.  Presumption---that is elmore

b.  Crushes ground and education that is the shell

c.  At best they will win that you should reject the argument and not
    the team in which case you reject the plan and vote negative

    1.  The damage is done---their refusal to specify their agent
        crushed pre-round prep, 1nc strategy---we will never get those
        back---the only recourse is to vote negative to protect us.

3.  1ar clarification is worst---normal means still links to the

REQUIREMENT: VOID FOR VAGUENESS?, Columbia Law Review, MARCH, 1990, 90
Colum. L. Rev. 489,

The issue of institutional competence is closely related to judicial
protection of individual freedoms. In the words of Justice Brennan,
**\"The requirement that government articulate its aims with a
reasonable degree of clarity ensures that state power will be exercised
only on behalf of policies reflecting an authoritative choice among
competing social values.\"** n128 The vagueness doctrine often reflects
a judicial balancing of interests, in which the decision whether or not
to find a statute unconstitutionally vague depends on the type of
conduct that the legislature is seeking to prevent. n129 For example, in
Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, n130 the Court invalidated a
vagrancy ordinance on vagueness grounds because the ordinance
criminalized \"activities \[that\] are historically part of the
amenities of life as we have known them,\" n131 including strolling,
wandering and walking at night. n132 In contrast, in Grayned v. City of
Rockford, n133 an antinoise ordinance that prohibited making noise near
a school in session that \"tended to disturb\" the school\'s functioning
was upheld against a vagueness challenge because the law\'s purpose was
to prevent the disruption of normal school activity. n134 In general,
statutes restricting conduct seen by the Court as within the legitimate
realm of government regulation tend to survive \[\*507\] vagueness
challenges, n135 while **statutes exceeding the legitimate reach of
government control tend to fall as overly vague. n136**

While these arguments have some merit, there is yet another oft-stated
argument against the use of legislative history that is entirely
unpersuasive. **That argument, pressed most vigorously by Justice**
**Scalia, is based on the factual assertion (probably true,** from my
own experience as a congressional staff member) **that only a small
minority of elected members of** **Congress actually read** committee
reports **or listen to floor debates on most legislation.** For example,
in [Blanchard v. Bergeron, 109 S. Ct. 939, 946-47

(Scalia, J., dissenting), Justice Scalia suggests that:\
 \
\[a\]s anyone familiar with modern-day drafting of congressional
committee reports is well aware, the \[matters at issue in the case\]
were inserted, at best by a committee staff member on his or her own
initiative, and at worst by a committee staff member at the suggestion
of a lawyer-lobbyist . . . .\
 \
(**Does Justice** **Scalia suggest that because law clerks insert many
footnotes in judicial opinions on their own initiative such notations
should not be considered authoritative?)** Justice Scalia has
republished a Senate floor colloquy designed to show that senators do
not read committee reports and therefore, these reports should not have
any effect on interpretation. See [Hirschey v. Federal Energy Regulatory
Comm\'n, 777 F.2d 1, 7-8 n.1 (D.C. Cir.

The republication has caused considerable judicial and academic
attention. See, e.g., [Wallace v. Christensen, 802 F.2d 1539, 1559-60

#  Aff Answers {#aff-answers .Block-Title}

> First offense

1)  Arbitrary. Their interp is always that we have to specify one more
    thing than is in plan. This kills aff predictibility, so to meet we
    would need an 8 minute plan text and the neg would always win on
    plan doing nothing.

2)  Counter Interp: agent is normal means. This solves their offense by
    allowing debates about what normal means is, and is most predictable
    because it's in the literature.

3)  Neg ground. With thousands of USfg agencies, we could specify them
    into bad or unpredictable ground.

4)  Counter interp: we can specify status quo plan implementation in
    cross x. This gives the neg link ground to agent DAs.

5)  Checks neg bias Topic.

    a)  No aff advantage areas.

    b)  Generics. Ks, politics, and domestic agent cps link to
        everything.

    c)  Structural. The neg block puts the 1ar at a time disadvantage,
        preventing good arguments for the 1ar or good extensions for the
        2ar.

6)  Justifies agent Counterplans. This is a voter

    a)  Utopian. No utopian decision maker means that counterplan isn't
        a test of opportunity cost.

    b)  Limits. Real world decision framework is the only non-arbitrary
        way to limit CP's.

    c)  Ground. No lit assumes a choice between two different agents.

    d)  Topic education. We already know about courts, we're here to
        research Africa.

> And, the defense

1)  Potential abuse isn\'t a voter. There is potential that the neg runs
    a new counterplan in the 2nr.

2)  DAs solve their offense. We still learn about implementation.

3)  Not 90% of solvency. Elmore is talking about solvency mechanism and
    implementation, not just the agent.

4)  No impact to ground loss. They only lose bad ground.

5)  Still resolved.

    a)  Resolved means we just have to be definite in affirming the
        resolution, not about the agent. Their interp means that we are
        indefinite because we wrote Sub-Saharan Africa instead of
        listing all the countries.

    b)  Resolved is before the colon. That means that the USfg is
        resolved about passage. This is best because theirs allows an
        infinite number of k frameworks.
