### **The Root Beneath the Tongue**

Night gathered like a bruise across the meadow.\
The air smelled of iron and wet bark.\
I followed the sound of water /\
until the sound began to follow me.

Something moved under the surface---\
not fish, not current---\
a thought shedding its skin.

I bent to drink.\
The river tasted of blood remembered too long,\
as if the world were exhaling through a wound.

A branch reached from the bank,\
touched my throat like a blind question.\
The question did not end.

The ground opened in slow delight.\
Roots slid across my feet,\
searching for the pulse of obedience.\
I offered it.

Mud rose, patient and articulate,\
its vowels slick with rot.\
Each breath I took /\
the soil took back,\
translating me into its grammar of hunger.

I felt my ribs flare like lanterns,\
then go out one by one.

Below the skin, the dark was meticulous.\
It knew my name only as echo,\
and fed that echo to worms.

When I tried to speak,\
the earth answered through my tongue---\
a low vibration, neither word nor moan,\
the sound of matter remembering itself.

At dawn, the field looked unchanged.\
Only the air shimmered a little,\
as if the horizon had swallowed something living\
and was still deciding whether to keep it.

#### Everything we [think]{.underline} we presume about the natural world is lost when the imperative to [produce]{.underline}, [enjoy]{.underline}, and discipline pushes us towards the illusion of total ipseity. The quest [to master]{.underline}, [to know]{.underline}, and to [defile]{.underline} brings us farther and farther away from the world inside us, outside us, and of us. 

#### The vortex is just a [temporary phenomenon]{.underline} amidst the sea which sustains it. 

#### 

#### That requires a constant negation of [intimacy and immanence]{.underline} which urges [accumulation]{.underline}, [mastery]{.underline}, and [rationalization]{.underline} of the external world\-\--truth is ignorance and non-knowledge is death. 

### **What the Soil Remembered**

I went into the field after the rain.\
The mud was open---black, shining, breathing.\
Each step a pulse. Each pulse an eye.

It watched from beneath,\
a patience older than root or ruin.\
The smell was not decay but **[attention]{.underline}**.\
It wanted everything back.

I knelt to touch it.\
It rose through my hand like fever,\
a warmth that unstitched thought from bone.

There was no mercy in it,\
only recognition---\
that the body is a door the earth forgot to close.

I heard the small applause of worms,\
their wet prayer folding language into humus.\
Every syllable they swallowed\
tasted like my own mouth trying to remember its first word.

The rain began again, slow and deliberate.\
It filled the sockets of stones,\
the hollows where roots had eaten light.\
I lay down, and the field adjusted.

Something beneath began to breathe for me.\
Its breath carried ash, pollen, and the memory of suns.\
I could not tell whether I was drowning or being born.

When the air cleared, I was lighter---\
the soil had kept its half of me.\
The rest walked home,\
carrying the sound of rain still moving through my chest.

#### But the sovereign is parasite to soil...

The continuity is in no way a homogenous plane of inert 'dead matter' in
conformity with 'the idea of science' (Bataille, Citation1985, p. 15).
It is rather a turbulent cosmic ocean of immense movements and turmoil.
[[There is]{.mark} **an [inherent heterogeneity to the world]{.mark},**
but [through processing,]{.mark} work, and interpretation, [we make the
world]{.mark} more and more [compliant]{.mark}. **We [create a
homogeneous]{.mark} world of [utility and purpose,]{.mark} thereby also
[limiting our perspective]{.mark}** to this stabilised
world.]{.underline} In other words, humanity tie itself to the notion of
the stationary earth. Bataille both asks and states:

How, indeed, can man claim to identify with the rapture of the heavens,
acknowledging itself as a spectacle viewing itself, when the fact of
looking presupposes that the viewing subject has somehow escaped from
the rapturous movement of the universe? [All that we can recognize as
[truth is]{.mark} necessarily [linked to the]{.mark} error represented
by the ['stationary earth'.]{.mark}]{.underline}

(Bataille, Citation1986b, p. 76)

[**[Humanity disrupts cosmic movements.]{.mark}** It externalises them
and [turns them into spectacles]{.mark}.]{.underline} Bataille
(Citation1989), describes how [humanity, **through the use of [tools,
disrupts nature's immanence]{.mark}. Nature's immanence is [the world as
it inherently is.]{.mark}**]{.underline} One we recognise as a bodily
relation that eludes exhaustive definition. It is [an all-encompassing
[continuity]{.mark} that humanity [shatters]{.mark}, but is still
entirely embraced by, like a ripple on the ocean. **[Humanity subjugates
nature]{.mark} by the use of tools, but in doing so, it also subjugates
the human to nature as a product of the tool,** that is to the useful
understanding of nature]{.underline} (Bataille, Citation1976b, p. 306).
Thus, [even in the simplest manipulation or [processing]{.mark} of
nature (immanence, continuity), there is an element of
[instrumentalisation]{.mark} and reification that [also subjugates
humans themselves.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even the gaze subjugates us
insofar as it links us to the world of things (Bataille, Citation2014,
p. 81). **[[Humans]{.mark} thus [actively negate nature,]{.mark} making
nature an external spectacle, [thereby]{.mark} also [negating nature
within themselves.]{.mark}]{.underline}**Footnote3 Bataille writes:

Nature giving birth to man was a dying mother: she gave 'being' to the
one whose coming into the world was her own death \[...\] The very
movement in which man negates Mother Earth who gave birth to him opens
the path of servitude.

(Bataille, Citation2014, pp. 81--82)

Thus, [[humans are a wound in nature]{.mark}'s immanence, a
[discontinuity in]{.mark} an all-encompassing [continuity]{.mark}. **In
[industrialised]{.mark} and modern [capitalist societies,]{.mark} this
exteriority of nature is escalated.** [Humans]{.mark} are [reduced to
consumers and producers,]{.mark} which [entails]{.mark} an implicit
[reification and **nature is**]{.mark} **in turn reduced to
[pantry]{.mark}, building [materials]{.mark}, recreational oases and
[goods]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Bataille writes: 'Capitalism in a sense
is an unreserved surrender to things, heedless of consequences and
seeing nothing beyond them' (Bataille, Citation1988, pp. 129--130). [In
order [to navigate]{.mark} in [the flowing]{.mark} and elusive [world of
becoming, **we create**]{.mark} **a world of [being]{.mark}, a
homogeneous and [stationary earth of utility]{.mark} and things.
[Beyond]{.mark} the established homogeneous world order, [lies all that
can't be]{.mark} completely [appropriated]{.mark} by its limited and
castrated perspective:** the sacred, [eroticism]{.mark}, intoxication,
lavishness, devotion, [tears]{.mark}, laughter, [generosity]{.mark}, and
ecstasy.]{.underline}

**The United States ought to rewild substantial tracts of land**

#### The ballot is nothing more than a form the judge fills out at the end of the round and to non-consensually assign additional role to the judge is would be an example of hegemonic ascription. However, we believe debate should promote relational modes of thinking of land and nature and thus judges should prioritize the toggling and theorizing of speculative futures that decenter hegemonic seperatist narratives of eco policy

When Stuart Kendall calls for an **[[ecological imagination]{.mark},
that is, the '[embodied imagination of place, an imagination in search
of connections and connectivity']{.mark}]{.underline}** (Kendall, 2010,
pp. 6--7), it **[[must ultimately be poetic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
ecological dwelling extends into the universe. **[From the [organic into
the inorganic and monstrous forces]{.mark} of the
univers]{.underline}**e. How then do we reconnect with the tragic
mother? This is a question that seems especially urgent in the time of
the Anthropocene or Capitalocene (Moore, 2016), where we now more than
ever are exhausting her. Acéphale was an attempt at founding a religion
on the death of god. A Dionysian festival in the belly of Gaia. It was
an attempt Bataille would later consider an utter failure that he
somewhat ridicules (see Bataille, 2011, p. 159). According to Bataille,
religion draws its sovereignty from poetic genius, since poetry binds
the 'poet to humanity and humanity to the universe' (2006, p. 84). The
identification of humanity and poetry underlines religion as a human
construct, but it also aligns poetry to the movement of the whole -- the
world in which we move (p. 83). **[[Such]{.mark} a [poetry ultimately
plunges us into the movement of the whole, depriving the 'isolated
being' of its position as 'subject and object]{.mark}]{.underline}**' in
an intense 'consumation of life in the present' (Bataille, 2023, p.
211). **[Thus, [poetry becomes a path towards the night of
non-knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a possible **[destruction of the
limitations of things and tools, and a return to the limitless
continuity of being]{.underline}** (2006, p. 84). Experiencing the
universe as such, Bataille describes the **['useless and infinite
fulfilment of the universe']{.underline}** (1988, p. 21). In a certain
sense, it entails a negation, but **[[it is ultimately a negation of a
negation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Thus, it is not a negation put to work
as part of a dialectical process towards completion and absolute
knowledge. **[The [subjugation of nature negates the immediacy of the
immanent experience]{.mark};]{.underline}** it negates the instant
(Bataille, 2023, p. 209). **[[Poetry negates the thingness of the thing
and returns it to the movement of all that which is no-thing.]{.mark} It
negates the stationary earth and its entailed
anthropocentrism]{.underline}** (Bataille, 1986b, p. 76) and returns
humans to the movements of the universe, **[allowing them to participate
in the communifying movement that composes the body, the biosphere, a
plant, or a galaxy]{.underline}**. It is an 'anthropomorphism torn
apart' (Bataille, 2011, p. 21). **[The poetic negation of the negation
makes possible a return to the instant, which Bataille equates with the
night. Thus, the useless and infinite fulfilment of the universe is
attained: 'in the night of the labyrinth', wherein 'death and life tear
each other apart like silence and thunder']{.underline}** (Bataille,
1970a, p. 493). The labyrinthine night Bataille finds in the belly of
the tragic mother. This unity of opposites, death and life, silence, and
thunder, entail excess, squandering, and loss. Bataille writes: Through
loss man can regain the free movement of the universe, he can dance and
swirl in the full rapture those great swarms of stars. But he must, in
the violent expenditure of self, perceive that he breathes in the power
of death. (Bataille, 1986b, p. 78) 'What is before me is never anything
less than the universe', Bataille states and continues: 'the universe is
not a thing and I am not at all mistaken when I see its brilliance in
the sun' (1988, p. 57). Yet everything we see has a movement of the
whole particular to it. Thus, a thing must be seen as participating in
everything else. Even the smallest plant, cell, stone or a car, a clock,
or a sewing machine, has a movement of the whole particular to it. To
write of even the smallest phenomenon can, in other words, be cosmic and
planetary. This might entail a parodic, even perverse poetic ecology,
constituting a new attunement of opposites, the poetic and the parodic,
where the egg is an eye is a bull's testicle and the sun, which
dissolves into universe, tears, piss, sunrays then plants, animals,
biosphere, and climate change. Today, this attunement of opposites is
encapsulated by the art-collective Mycelium. They define the
simultaneity of life and death in the term 'Necrobiosis', drawing
heavily on Bataille: [**[Necrobiosis: The state of
death-life]{.underline}**. **[Denoting the simultaneity of life and
death]{.underline}** in **[the breaking down of living tissue, cells,
structures, or language]{.underline}**]{.mark}, in order to become
something else. A sun becoming a sign. A sign becoming a seed. A seed
becoming a flower. A flower becoming a gesture. A gesture becoming
tears. Tears becoming sea. Sea becoming sun. Sun becoming eye. Eye
becoming egg. Egg becoming larva. Larva becoming cocoon. Cocoon becoming
moth. Or a sun becoming a sign, a word, a weapon, means of oppression,
church, commodity. (Mycelium, 2024, p. 15) Notice how the sign is
double. On the one hand, a seed and on the other, a word instigating a
regime of signification, oppression, and power. Albeit both emanated
from a sun. Let us thus return to the image of the double sun. Another
**[double sun emerges. No longer the idealised and the rotten, but
rather the double sun of noon and midnight, of death and
life]{.underline}**. Bataille quotes a passage from Nietzsche's Thus
Spoke Zarathurstra in the beginning of Inner Experience: '**[Night is
also a sun']{.underline}** (Bataille, 2014, p. 2). This statement is
derived from a passage where **[everything is experienced in a sovereign
moment, where opposites are united, such as noon, midnight, sadness,
joy, curse, and blessing. 'All things are enchained, entwined,
enamored']{.underline}** (Nietzsche, 2006, p. 263), Zarathustra
exclaims. Everything is entwined as countless chains of beings spinning
numerous labyrinthine threads between the largest and the smallest.
Zarathustra exclaims this when the redemption of the eternal return is
attained in the transgression of the reactive and burdensome image of
life, that is, in **[the affirmative negation of the
negation]{.underline}**, where you can say 'I like you, happiness!
Whoosh! Moment!' (Nietzsche, 2006, p. 263). These are the moments to
which poetry can be a passage. **[Bursts of unproductive and useless
expenditure, releasing the human from the reactive and anthropocentric
image of man,]{.underline}** releasing the sun, both noon and midnight,
from the shackles of utility. It recognises how we participate in the
movements of the social sphere, the biosphere, the solar system, and the
universe as such, each with a movement of the whole particular to it. In
other words, it concerns poetry as a way to **[squander the accursed
share within the general ecology.]{.underline}** The experience of
everything as entwined is an experience of the communifying movements of
the universe. **[It is an experience of a community of all that which is
nothing]{.underline}**. On a planetary scale, it is the Earth as the
Tragic Mother, Gaia, the sacred ground for the death and rebirth of
Dionysos. On a cosmic scale, we might somewhat freely consider the Earth
as Solaris after Stanislaw Lem's masterpiece. That is, as **[a planet
covered by a sea of life and death]{.underline}**, with ebbs and floods,
orbiting a dual sun, both noon and midnight. Its **[poets]{.underline}**
must **[sing songs of both night and day, death and life, the
necrobiotic dual sun]{.underline}**. We live in a time of an ongoing
global climate catastrophe, the sixth mass extinction and an ongoing
biodiversity crisis. Will poetry save us? Hardly. We need action. But
**[action without imagination and a sense of a community that extends
beyond the merely human is bound to fail.]{.underline}** We must
recognise that such a community extends into the belly of the tragic
mother, into the Dionysian forest, into the monstrous abyss of the
impossible and into the realm of the nonhuman. Action is ultimately tied
to the realm of usefulness. From such a gelded and restricted economic
outlook, we can only imagine abstinence or technological solutions to
symptoms of the problem. Thus, we can only strive towards a more
rational production, not recognising that such a reduction of life and
the biological processes is part of the problem. [**[We need to engage
with the world as useless, joyous, and monstruous, bound by no
utilitarian purpose]{.underline}**. **[We need action that recognises
non-action and gives space]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[This implies a
generous and squandering expenditure of self. Insofar as poetry is an
affirmative negation of a negation]{.underline}**, even the protest, the
rebellious no, can be said to carry the poetic affirmation. [Solar
poetry should be the heart of any ecological mobilisation]{.underline}.
